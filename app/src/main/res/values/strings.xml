    <string name="story_house_arryn">House Arryn is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It has
        ruled over the Vale of Arryn for millennia, originally as the Kings of Mountain and Vale
        and more recently as Lords Paramount of the Vale and Wardens of the East under the
        Targaryen kings and King Robert Baratheon. The nominal head of House Arryn is Robin Arryn,

    <string name="story_house_baratheon">House Baratheon of Storm&#8217;s End was one of the Great Houses
        of Westeros, although also one of the youngest. It is the current royal house. \n\n
        House Baratheon&#8217;s sigil is a black stag on a gold background and their house motto is
        &#8221;Ours is the Fury&#8221;. When Robert ascended the Iron Throne, a gold crown was
        added to the stag, denoting their status as the royal house. \n\n The ancestral Baratheon
        stronghold is Storm&#8217;s End, but since becoming the royal house, they have also taken
        possession of the old Targaryen island fortress of Dragonstone, while the King rules
        from the city of King&#8217;s Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms.</string>

    <string name="story_house_bolton">House Bolton of the Dreadfort is the ruling house of the
        North, having usurped their position from their former liege lords: House Stark. Their
        original lands are in the northeast of the formerly-owned Stark territories. Their
        stronghold is a castle called the Dreadfort and the head of the house is the Lord of
        the Dreadfort. \n\n House Bolton is infamous for its centuries-old practice of flaying
        their enemies alive, to the point that they use a flayed man as their House sigil.
        The Boltons supposedly gave up this practice after bending the knee to House Stark,
        and centuries later Lord Eddard Stark outlawed flaying in the North altogether,
        but the Boltons continue the practice.</string>

    <string name="story_house_frey">House Frey is the current Great House of the Riverlands,
        having gained their position for their treachery against their former liege lords,
        House Tully, who were stripped of all their titles for their rebellion against the
        Iron Throne. They are also now the Lords of Riverrun. Its current ruler is Lord Walder
        Frey. \n\n Their castle is known as the Twins, for its two identical keeps on either side
        of a river linked by a bridge, sometimes called the Stone Bridge. The Twins is one of the
        primary crossings over the Green Fork of the Trident River, and tolls from bridge
        crossings have made the Freys quite wealthy fairly quickly, elevating them from obscurity
        six centuries ago to being one of the most powerful noble Houses in the Riverlands -
        though they are looked down upon by older aristocratic families.</string>

        lands are the Iron Islands off the west coast of the continent. They rule from their
        castle Pyke from the island of the same name. The Iron Islands are harsh and bleak and
        the Greyjoys have traditionally survived by raiding their neighbors. They have always had
        plans to conquer the mainland. The head of the house is the Lord Reaper of Pyke. \n\n
        House Greyjoy boasts descent from the Grey King, a legendary King of the Iron Islands
        said to have ruled for a thousand years and taken a mermaid as wife. Like the vast
        majority of ironborn, they worship the Drowned God.</string>

        Houses of Westeros, one of its richest and most powerful families and oldest dynasties.
        The major characters Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion and the recurring characters Tywin, Kevan,
        and Lancel are members of the house. Tywin is the head of House Lannister and Lord of
        Casterly Rock. \n\n Their lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is
        Casterly Rock, a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had
        habitations and fortifications built into it over the millennia. They are the Lords
        Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West. House Lannister&#8217;s Heraldry consists
        of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their House words are &#8220;Hear me
        roar!&#8220;, which is rarely mentioned. Their unofficial motto, which is as well known
        as the official one, is &#8220;A Lannister always pays his debts&#8220; - which is used
        much more often and mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the
        original, literal sense.</string>

    <string name="story_house_stark">House Stark of Winterfell is an exiled Great House of
        Westeros, ruling over the vast region known as the North from their seat in Winterfell.
        It is by far one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility, claiming a line of descent
        stretching back over eight thousand years. The head of the house was the Lord of
        Winterfell. Before the Targaryen conquest, the leaders of House Stark ruled over
        the region as the Kings in the North. \n\n Their rule in the North seemingly ended after
        the events of the Red Wedding when House Frey and House Bolton betrayed them, and
        Roose Bolton personally killed King Robb Stark. Both the North and Winterfell have since
        been taken over by the Boltons but their hold has been jeopardized now that Sansa Stark
        has escaped their clutches after learning that her brothers Bran and Rickon Stark

        of the Red Fork of the Trident with the Tumblestone. They rule over the Riverlands from the
        castle and the head of the house is the Lord of Riverrun. \n\n House Tully rose to
        prominence during the Wars of Conquest. Lord Edmyn Tully rebelled against the King of the
        Isles and the Riverlands, Harren the Black, to support the invading House Targaryen.
        Edmyn&#8217;s fellow Riverlords followed his lead. When Aegon Targaryen established his rule
        from the Iron Throne he rewarded Edmyn, elevating the Tullys to Lords Paramount of the
        Riverlands. \n\n Its current head is Lord Edmure Tully. His sisters, Catelyn and Lysa,

        Mace Tyrell, although his mother, the indomitable Olenna Tyrell, still wields considerable
        influence over the House&#8217;s affairs and is usually considered the true leader of the family.
        Mace&#8217;s son Loras is a noted tournament knight (and, secretly, the lover of Lord Renly
        Baratheon). Mace&#8217;s daughter Margaery married Renly when he crowned himself king, to cement
        the alliance between Renly and her father. Following Renly&#8217;s death, Margaery was then
        married to King Joffrey Baratheon before his assassination at his wedding feast. She is

        group working against Lannister interests in the Riverlands at the time of the War of the
        Five Kings, though their goal is to protect the smallfolk from any force preying on them,
        regardless of which King or Lord they support. \n\nThe group was indirectly created by
        Eddard Stark, when he sent out a force of knights to restore peace and justice to the
        Riverlands, bolstered by several of his own household guards from House Stark. Trapped
        behind enemy lines, they became a guerrilla fighting group, and were joined by deserters
        from different armies in the war as well as commoners trying to defend their homes. The
        Brotherhood continues to fight to protect the commoners of the Riverlands in the name of
        King Robert and Lord Eddard. \n\n Following the Red Wedding, the Brotherhood Without

        clients across Essos and Westeros, including the government of the King of the Andals and
        the First Men who rules over the Seven Kingdoms. \n\n Just as a common saying about House
        Lannister is &#8220;A Lannister always pays his debts&#8221;, there is also a common saying
        that the bank often reminds its clients who fail to repay their loans: &#8220;the Iron Bank
        will have its due&#8221;. \n\n The symbol of the Iron Bank depicts two golden triangles

        royal bodyguard of the King of the Andals and the First Men. Their duty is to protect the
        king and the royal family from harm at all times. The Kingsguard swear the most holy of
        vows to fulfill their sacred duty, and - in theory - are meant to be the living exemplars
        of the pinnacle of knightly virtues. Like the brothers of the Night&#8217;s Watch, members of

        from the stronghold of Castle Black up until his death by mutineers. And before Jon was
        led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, who also was killed in a mutiny. The current Lord
        Commander is still to be decided. \n\n The Night&#8217;s Watch consists of three groups: the
        Rangers, who fight, defend the Wall and patrol the Haunted Forest; the Builders,

        the seasons last for years at a time. The action begins in the unified Seven Kingdoms of
        Westeros as the long summer ends and winter draws near. Lord Eddard Stark is asked by his
        old friend, King Robert Baratheon, to serve as the Hand of the King following the death of
        the previous incumbent, Eddard&#8217;s mentor Jon Arryn. Eddard is reluctant, but receives
        intelligence suggesting that Jon was murdered. Eddard accepts Robert&#8217;s offer, planning to
        use his position and authority to investigate the alleged murder. \n\nMeanwhile, on the
        eastern continent of Essos, the exiled children of House Targaryen, which Robert destroyed
        to claim the throne, are plotting to return to Westeros and unseat the &#8217;usurper&#8217;. To this
        end, Viserys Targaryen arranges the marriage of his sister Daenerys to Khal Drogo, the
        leader of 40,000 Dothraki warriors, in return for the use of his warriors in invading
        Westeros. For her part, Daenerys just wants to find a safe refuge far away from King
        Robert&#8217;s assassins and her brother&#8217;s scheming ambition. \n\n Finally, on the northern-most
        border of the Seven Kingdoms the sworn brothers of the Night&#8217;s Watch guard the Wall, a
        300-mile-long colossal fortification of ice which has stood for thousands of years. The
        Watch defends the Wall against the depredations of the lawless wildlings who live beyond,
        but rumor speaks of a new threat arising in the lands of perpetual winter.</string>

    <string name="story_season_02_plot">Season 2 spans several months on a world where the seasons
        last for years at a time. The Seven Kingdoms are at war, with the King in the North, Robb
        Stark, fighting to win independence for his people and those of the Riverlands. Robb
        decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent ironborn to his cause,
        and sends his best friend Theon Greyjoy to treat with his father, who is hatching plans of
        his own. Meanwhile, Joffrey Baratheon holds the Iron Throne with the backing of the
        powerful House Lannister, but his uncle Renly has also claimed the throne with the support
        of House Tyrell, whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne, Tyrion
        Lannister arrives in King&#8217;s Landing to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from
        his scheming sister, Cersei, now the Queen Regent. \n\n However, there is another faction
        entering the picture. Stannis Baratheon, Robert&#8217;s younger brother and Renly&#8217;s older brother,
        has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of several wars,
        Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even
        if it destroys him. Advising him is Melisandre, an enigmatic priestess from the east, who
        believes Stannis is meant for a greater destiny, and Ser Davos Seaworth, an honest and
        honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis&#8217; court. \n\n Far to the east,
        Daenerys Targaryen has hatched the only three dragons in the world. Eventually they will
        grow into terrifying monsters capable of destroying cities at her command, but for now
        they are still hatchlings and vulnerable. With her khalasar gone, Daenerys and her small
        band of followers must find a way across a forbidding wasteland and find new allies to
        support her claim to the Iron Throne. \n\n In the distant north, the Night&#8217;s Watch has
        mounted an expedition beyond the Wall, searching for missing rangers and investigating
        rumors of wildlings gathering in the mountains. For Jon Snow this will be a rite of
        passage as he is asked to make difficult choices, for the realm and for himself.</string>

    <string name="title_season_03_plot">Season 3 Plot</string>
    <string name="story_season_03_plot">Season 3 spans several months on a world where the seasons
        can last for years at a time. Autumn has fallen across the world, with winter not far
        behind. The people should be preparing for years of snow and ice, but the Seven Kingdoms
        of Westeros instead remain gripped by civil war. Would-be king Renly Baratheon has been
        assassinated, altering the alliances in the war. The cruel boy-king Joffrey Baratheon has
        won a great victory by securing an alliance with House Tyrell, with his supporters
        defeating his uncle Stannis in an epic battle. Joffrey now commands the largest armies
        in the realm and his triumph appears inevitable. \n\n King Robb Stark remains in the field,
        however his homeland, the North, is partially under ironborn occupation. Robb needs to
        decide on a course of action to win an overall victory. He must also win back the
        allegiance of House Frey, whom he has offended by breaking his marriage pact with them.
        King Robb has won every battle he has fought, but as with old King Robert, the Starks will
        have to see if good soldiers make good kings. \n\n Stannis Baratheon may be defeated and
        most of his army destroyed or scattered, but he is not out of the fight yet. Having
        retreated to his headquarters on Dragonstone island with his handful of surviving soldiers,
        Stannis&#8217; status as the last legitimate heir to his older brother Robert still casts a
        shadow over Joffrey&#8217;s claim to the throne. With the priestess Melisandre at his side,
        Stannis can still influence the course of the war by striking where least expected. \n\n
        The lives of many others still hang in the balance. Bran Stark and his protectors must
        cross the frozen wastelands of the North to reach the Wall, while Arya must brave the
        war-torn Riverlands in search of her mother and brother. Brienne of Tarth also has the
        thankless task of escorting the captive Jaime Lannister home across hundreds of miles of
        battlefields and carnage. Theon Greyjoy must face the consequences of his actions at
        Winterfell. And in King&#8217;s Landing both Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark must brave the
        currents of a much more dangerous court in order to survive. \n\n On the eastern continent,
        Daenerys Targaryen has fled the political viper-pit of Qarth. Her dragons are growing and
        her fame is spreading, but to take the Iron Throne she will need supporters and an army.
        Both may be found in the corrupt cities of Slaver&#8217;s Bay... for a price. \n\n Beyond the
        Wall, the White Walkers are on the move, threatening both the Seven Kingdoms and the lands
        of the Free Folk. While the Night&#8217;s Watch faces the threat of the White Walkers in the
        field, Jon Snow must infiltrate the wildling army of Mance Rayder and discover the
        King-Beyond-the-Wall&#8217;s plans.</string>

    <!-- Season 04 Plot -->
    <string name="title_season_04_plot">Season 4 Plot</string>
    <string name="story_season_04_plot">The War of the Five Kings is drawing to a close, but new
        intrigues and plots are in motion, and the surviving factions must contend with enemies not
        only outside their ranks, but within. \n\n King in the North Robb Stark is dead, betrayed
        by his own bannermen the Boltons and Freys while he was a guest under the Freys&#8217; roof.
        Robb&#8217;s mother Catelyn and his wife Talisa, along with most of the Northern leadership were
        also killed at the massacre now known as the Red Wedding, along with the entire Northern
        army. \n\n Having already defeated Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of the Blackwater and
        secured southern Westeros, House Lannister stands triumphant. The crazed boy-king Joffrey
        Baratheon gloats, though the victory truly belongs to his grandfather, Lord Tywin Lannister,
        Hand of the King and the real power behind the Iron Throne. As reward for their betrayal,
        Tywin has granted the Boltons rule of the North, and the Freys with nominal rule of
        Riverrun, though the castle remains under the command of Brynden Tully. \n\n Though the
        mainland of Westeros is mostly under Lannister control, there are still two factions
        defying them: the Greyjoys and the Baratheons. Ironborn occupiers remaining in the North
        are being hunted down by Ramsay Snow, bastard son of Roose Bolton. Ramsay holds Theon
        Greyjoy hostage, horribly torturing him at whim, but Balon Greyjoy considers his son as
        good as dead. \n\n Stannis Baratheon, as the rightful heir to his older brother King Robert,
        still refuses to surrender, despite having only the remnants of an army. However, following
        the advice of Melisandre, he has focused his attention of the threat of the wildlings
        marching against the Wall. \n\n The Lannisters only managed to win on the battlefield with
        the key support of House Tyrell of the Reach, which they won through promising a
        marriage-alliance between King Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell, daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell.
        Queen Regent Cersei fears - correctly - that just as the Baratheons became dependent on the
        Lannisters after Robert&#8217;s Rebellion, the Lannisters are starting to become dependent on
        the Tyrells, who are already insinuating themselves into positions of power at King&#8217;s
        Landing. A royal wedding is to be held between Joffrey and Margaery, which will confirm
        the future of the realm. \n\n The only two kingdoms which have remained entirely aloof
        from the war so far are the Vale of Arryn and Dorne. While Lysa Arryn chose to remain
        neutral, former Master of Coin and new Lord of Harrenhal Petyr Baelish has been sent by
        Lord Tywin to woo her with a marriage proposal, now that he&#8217;s a high lord and a suitable
        match for the Lady Regent of the Vale. Nevertheless only Littlefinger knows what
        Littlefinger is plotting. \n\n For their own part, House Martell of Dorne has loathed the
        Lannisters ever since the Sack of King&#8217;s Landing, when Ser Gregor Clegane raped and killed
        Elia Martell - sister of Doran Martell, the ruling Prince of Dorne - and Lord Tywin did
        nothing to punish him. During the War of the Five Kings Tyrion Lannister prevented Dorne
        from declaring for any of House Lannister&#8217;s enemies by sending Princess Myrcella to
        Sunspear as part of her betrothal to Prince Trystane Martell, and in return, the Martells
        were promised a seat on the Small Council. To the consternation of the Lannisters, a large
        Dornish embassy arrives in King&#8217;s Landing to claim their due - but instead of the elderly
        Prince Doran, his brash younger brother Prince Oberyn comes to claim the council seat.
        Oberyn loves the ladies, he loves the boys, but most of all he loved his sister Elia, and
        the Lannisters aren&#8217;t the only ones who pay their debts. \n\n Meanwhile, across the Narrow
        Sea in Slaver&#8217;s Bay, perhaps the greatest threat to Lannister rule is rapidly growing in
        strength. Daenerys Targaryen now commands not just three live dragons - who are starting to
        grow large enough to serve as decisive weapons of war - but also an army of eight thousand
        Unsullied warrior-eunuchs. For now, Queen Daenerys is carving a path through Slaver&#8217;s Bay
        - not of conquest but of liberation. As functionally once a slave herself, Daenerys is
        determined to free the downtrodden slaves of the region. First Astapor and then Yunkai fell
        before Daenerys&#8217;s forces, and hundreds of thousands of freed slaves now flock to her banner.
        Yet Daenerys must now face the last and greatest of the slaver-cities, Meereen - and unlike
        her previous victories, they have had time to prepare for her arrival. \n\n Far to the
        north, beyond the politics and meaningless feuds of the south, the Wall and the dwindling
        Night&#8217;s Watch are all that stand between the Seven Kingdoms and the horrors beyond. The
        White Walkers have emerged in force, leading their armies of wights. The wildlings have
        rallied behind King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder in an attempt to flee south, knowing that
        as the White Walkers advance, anyone who remain in the lands beyond the Wall will die and
        become part of the undead host. Mance&#8217;s wildling army now numbers in the tens of thousands,
        and is determined to force its way through the Wall to reach the safety of the south. All
        that stands between the Seven Kingdoms and this barbarian invasion is the Night&#8217;s Watch,
        whose numbers and leadership were recently devastated with the deaths of a third of their
        number and that of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly do what they can
        to prepare Castle Black for the massive wildling attack. \n\n Not only are the Night&#8217;s
        Watch outnumbered and their remaining leadership fractured, but advanced raiding bands of
        wildlings have infiltrated behind the Wall by climbing over it, preparing to attack the
        weakly defended southern side of Castle Black. These warbands are led by Tormund and the
        fearsome Styr, Magnar of Thenn - as well as Jon Snow&#8217;s ex-lover Ygritte, whom he betrayed
        when he revealed his true loyalty and returned to the Night&#8217;s Watch. \n\n In the Seven
        Kingdoms, while House Stark stands on the verge of extinction - and is believed to be just
        that by the realm at large - four &#8220;lone wolves&#8221; fight to survive: Sansa Stark
        remains a hostage of the Iron Throne and a forced marriage to Tyrion Lannister, Rickon
        Stark seeks the safety of Last Hearth and the fiercely loyal House Umber, Bran Stark and
        his companions Hodor, Jojen and Meera Reed have crossed the Wall chasing a vision, and Arya
        Stark, having lost everything and forced to rely on the protection of a man she hates,
        clings to survival and her thirst for vengeance.</string>

    <string name="title_season_05_plot">Season 5 Plot</string>
    <string name="story_season_05_plot">
        The War of the Five Kings, once thought to be drawing to a close, is instead entering a new
        and more chaotic phase. Westeros is on the brink of collapse, and many are seizing what
        they can while the realm implodes, like a corpse making a feast for crows. \n\n Tywin
        Lannister is dead, shot on the privy by his long-abused dwarf son Tyrion. The crazed
        boy-king Joffrey Baratheon, Tywin&#8217;s grandson, is also dead after being poisoned at his own
        wedding, and succeeded by his younger and more pliable brother, Tommen. Queen Cersei
        Lannister succeeds her father as the head of House Lannister, and once again takes over
        as Queen Regent, as Tommen has yet to come of age. Cersei has been blocked by several
        powerful men over the years, including her husband King Robert Baratheon and his friend
        Eddard Stark, but due to her betrayals they are both dead. Now with even Tywin and Joffrey
        dead, and Tyrion fleeing the realm, there are no more checks on Cersei&#8217;s power, and she is
        essentially the Ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms in all but name. However, Cersei is
        neither a master strategist nor a skilled diplomat (unlike her father and brother) and she
        faces mounting crises that would have strained even their abilities. \n\n House Lannister
        and its allies have managed to crush House Stark, but in many ways it was a pyrrhic victory.
        The Iron Throne was already in massive debt to foreign banks before the war even began,
        and the Lannisters&#8217; immense wartime spending increased the crown&#8217;s debts to crippling
        levels. The Lannisters must now desperately attempt to placate the Iron Bank of Braavos,
        by far the largest of the foreign banks, and the one which the crown owes most of its huge
        debts to. \n\n The game of thrones is, unfortunately, not a simple game of cyvasse in
        which the pieces can be quickly reassembled: vast swathes of Westeros have been devastated
        by civil war, and it may take a full generation for them to rebuild. The Riverlands, where
        most of the war was fought, have been reduced to a burned out husk. Nominally the
        Lannisters and their House Frey allies control the Riverlands, but it has been reduced to
        a lawless and corpse-filled devastation, hardly controlled by anyone. Winter is fast
        approaching, but instead of stockpiling harvests the past few years, the great lords have
        been busy destroying one of the main breadbasket regions of the Seven Kingdoms. Combined
        with the realm&#8217;s massive debts to foreign banks, starvation level conditions are starting
        to set in for the smallfolk across the realm. Outraged by the willful indifference of their
        rulers to their well-being for so long, commoners are starting to fall back onto old
        cultural touchstones, channeling their frustration into religious fanaticism. A popular
        disgust movement spreads across Westeros, and makes its way to the capital. \n\n Adding to
        these woes is the increasing rivalry between the Lannisters and their Tyrell allies,
        specifically between Cersei and Margaery Tyrell. The Lannisters only managed to win on the
        battlefield with the armies and food resources won by their alliance with the House Tyrell
        of the Reach. Now that Tywin is dead, and Margaery is soon to be King Tommen&#8217;s queen, the
        Tyrells are no longer pretending to be polite to the Lannisters, but openly demanding
        greater concessions and key positions of power. With half of the Lannister armies
        slaughtered by Robb Stark during the war, their financial resources depleted, and the
        Tyrells controlling the only major breadbasket region untouched by the war, the Lannisters
        are having to face the reality that the Tyrells hold numerous advantages over them. Just
        as Robert Baratheon became king only to become dependent on the support of the Lannisters,
        the Lannisters have now become dependent on the Tyrells. \n\n Without the political acumen
        of Tywin or Tyrion, Queen Regent Cersei struggles to address these major challenges. Adding
        even further to her woes is that the king&#8217;s Small Council has been gutted, with Hand of the
        King Tywin dead, Master of Coin Petyr Baelish leaving for the Eyrie, and both Tyrion and
        Master of Whisperers Varys fleeing the capital city. Of the original Small Council when the
        Lannisters first seized power, only Grand Maester Pycelle remains. \n\n Besides the Reach,
        only the regions which have remained neutral so far still have all of their armies and
        resources intact: the Vale, ruled by House Arryn, and Dorne, ruled by House Martell. With
        nearly all the other Great Houses defeated or half-exhausted, the fresh armies of the Vale
        and Dorne can drastically alter the political playing field, depending on which side they
        choose to join. \n\n The ultimate result of the war was to exhaust the Starks, Lannisters,
        and other Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms - exactly as Petyr &#8220;Littlefinger&#8221; Baelish had
        planned. The secret architect of the conflict, it was Littlefinger who was responsible for
        poisoning Robert&#8217;s Hand, Jon Arryn, by conspiring with his own wife Lysa Arryn.
        Littlefinger then engineered the betrayal of Eddard Stark, only to later assist Olenna
        Tyrell in assassinating King Joffrey at his own wedding. Baelish has now murdered Lysa,
        mere days after wedding her, and seized power over the Vale as regent for her young son.
        For the moment, Baelish remains in the Vale, consolidating his new hold over the Vale
        lords through his stepson Robin and his position as Lord Protector of the Vale. Alongside
        Baelish is the black-haired &#8220;Alayne&#8221;, his ward and &#8220;niece&#8221; - secretly, Sansa Stark, who
        fell into Littlefinger&#8217;s custody after he helped her escape her long imprisonment at
        Joffrey&#8217;s royal court. \n\n In the deserts of the deep south of Westeros, the people of
        Dorne demand vengeance for the death of Prince Oberyn, who died in a trial by combat at the
        hands of Ser Gregor Clegane. Leading the call to enter the war against the Lannisters are
        Oberyn&#8217;s paramour, Ellaria Sand, and the eldest of his eight daughters: Obara, Nymeria,
        and Tyene. But Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne and Oberyn&#8217;s older brother, continues
        to urge restraint. Further complicating the matter is that early in the war, the Lannisters
        bribed the Martells into staying neutral by offering a marriage-alliance, sending Cersei&#8217;s
        daughter Myrcella to Dorne to betroth her to Doran&#8217;s son Trystane. Myrcella is still a ward
        living in Dorne&#8217;s capital, Sunspear. \n\ The most dire situation in Westeros, however, is
        in the North and at the Wall. The massive assault against Castle Black by the wildling army
        of Mance Rayder was defeated at the last moment by the surprise arrival of Stannis
        Baratheon and his remaining forces. Stannis withdrew from his island stronghold Dragonstone
        to reach the Wall by sea, to defend the realm of which he feels he is the only rightful
        king. With his home territories in the Stormlands overrun, Stannis needs to win the
        allegiance of Robb Stark&#8217;s defeated bannermen, to rally the North again as a springboard
        against Lannister rule, as well as the support of Jon Snow, who therefore must walk a
        political tightrope between Stannis and his vows, since the Night&#8217;s Watch is sworn to
        strict political neutrality. Though the battle against the wildlings is all but over, the
        Night&#8217;s Watch is in its own dire conditions. With almost all of the Watch&#8217;s top officers
        either killed or missing, among them Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and First Ranger Benjen
        Stark, the organization has been left leaderless during this time of crisis, and therefore
        will have to navigate a contentious election for a new Lord Commander. All the while, the
        White Walkers and their ever-growing army of the dead are bearing down on the Wall itself,
        intent on spilling over it to destroy the lands of men beyond, who remain ignorant of the
        long-forgotten but all-too-real danger. \n\n The main armies of the Northern Houses,
        however, were slaughtered in the south at the Red Wedding, and the large main army of
        House Bolton has just returned to the North following the recapture of Moat Cailin. The
        Boltons switched to the Lannister side during the betrayal at the Red Wedding, during which
        their leader Lord Roose Bolton personally killed Robb Stark, and they have been installed
        as the new rulers of the North in the name of King Tommen and the Lannisters. With the
        other Northern Houses defeated and weakened, the Lannister-backed Bolton army can now
        suppress any feeble opposition to their rule. Meanwhile, Roose&#8217;s psychopathic bastard son
        Ramsay Snow - now legitimized as Ramsay Bolton - is the new Lord of Winterfell under his
        father, reoccupying the castle which he personally burned out previously. With the Boltons
        in power, Ramsay is now free to commit numerous atrocities throughout the North, such as
        flaying men alive and hunting and killing young women for sport. \n\n However, the struggle
        for the North is not yet over. Various areas of the North&#8217;s western coast are still held by
        ironborn invaders under Balon Greyjoy, who chose to crown himself as King of the Iron
        Islands and attack the North during Robb Stark&#8217;s march south rather than ally with him
        against the Lannisters. Balon&#8217;s son and heir, Theon, who himself was a ward of Lord Eddard
        Stark and one of Robb&#8217;s closest advisors, turned on the Starks and led the assault himself
        but was betrayed by his own men and is now a prisoner of the Boltons, having been brutally
        flayed, tortured, and psychologically broken by Ramsay himself, who has reduced Theon to
        his personal slave, &#8220;Reek&#8221;. \n\n East of Westeros, after murdering his own father, Tyrion
        Lannister has fled across the Narrow Sea to the Free Cities, his future intentions unknown
        even to himself. Accompanied by Varys, he arrives in the east, unaware that the erstwhile
        Master of Whisperers might yet have secrets to reveal. Further north, meanwhile,
        representatives from the Iron Throne travel to the Free City of Braavos to assuage the Iron
        Bank&#8217;s frustrations about all of the money the Lannisters owe. Unbeknownst to all, Arya
        Stark has also fled to Braavos, due to a favor she was owed for saving the life of one of
        the mysterious guild of assassins in Braavos known as the Faceless Men. \n\n Further east
        in Slaver&#8217;s Bay, Daenerys Targaryen&#8217;s hold over Meereen has become very precarious, as
        ruling the city is becoming much more difficult than conquering it was. Sectarian violence
        is rampant between the former slaves and former slave-masters, revenge attacks are on the
        rise, and the resurgent slavers at Yunkai are rallying all those who oppose her. Daenerys&#8217;s
        three dragons, now growing to dangerous size, have become uncontrollable and she can no
        longer rely upon them to defeat her enemies on the battlefield. Drogon burned a child to
        death while he was hunting and fled the city, forcing Daenerys to chain up the remaining
        two dragons in the caverns underneath the city. In addition, Daenerys is still distraught
        over the recent revelations concerning her once-trusted advisor Jorah Mormont, whom she
        exiled from the city as punishment. Her remaining advisors Ser Barristan Selmy, Missandei,
        and the sellsword Daario Naharis attempt to help hold her reign together. \n\n But
        unbeknownst to Daenerys, word has finally spread to Westeros that the last living Targaryen
        heir has hatched three live dragons. No longer a mere curiosity halfway across the world,
        several different factions in Westeros are now pondering how Daenerys and her dragons will
        factor into the already confusing and multi-sided civil war still tearing the Seven Kingdoms
        apart. Envoys are beginning to head east to court Daenerys&#8217;s allegiance: but those who try
        to dance with dragons run the risk of being burned.

    <!-- Character Stark Eddard -->
    <string name="title_character_stark_eddard">Eddard Stark</string>
    <string name="background_character_stark_eddard">Eddard Stark is the head of House Stark and Lord
        Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms,
        and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from
        their seat of Winterfell, and Eddard also holds the title Lord of Winterfell. In addition,
        he is the Warden of the North. \n\n Eddard is married to Lady Catelyn of House Tully.
        Though they barely knew one another when they wed, they formed a strong and loving
        marriage. They have five legitimate children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Eddard
        also has an illegitimate bastard son, Jon Snow, reportedly by a common serving girl named
        Wylla. Jon&#8217;s presence at Winterfell is a source of friction between Eddard and his wife.
        Nevertheless, Eddard was close to all his children and was well-loved and respected by all
        of them. He seemed to have a soft spot for his youngest daughter, Arya. \n\n Eddard is the
        second son of Lord Rickard Stark. Lord Rickard served King Aerys II Targaryen as Warden of
        the North. Eddard&#8217;s older brother Brandon was Rickard&#8217;s heir. Eddard also has a younger
        sister Lyanna and a younger brother Benjen. Eddard is a stoic, dutiful, and honorable man
        and is considered to embody the values of the North. \n\n Eddard is a trusted, close friend
        and counselor of King Robert Baratheon. He supported Robert&#8217;s play for the throne by
        acting as a general in several major battles. Eddard&#8217;s sister Lyanna, who was betrothed to
        Robert, was kidnapped by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, sparking the war. Brandon protested the
        kidnapping, but his attempt to bring Rhaegar to justice failed. Lord Rickard was summoned
        to court in King&#8217;s Landing by Aerys, and both Brandon and Rickard were executed by the Mad
        King. Their deaths left Eddard to inherit Rickard&#8217;s responsibilities, serving King Robert
        instead. Brandon had been betrothed to Catelyn, and Eddard also inherited his brother&#8217;s
        bride. Lyanna died in Eddard&#8217;s arms during the conflict. Despite his happy family life,
        Eddard still felt the losses of his family quite keenly, often visiting his sister&#8217;s tomb
        to light a candle for her as his daughter, Sansa, remembered. \n\n Eddard&#8217;s other younger
        sibling, Benjen, still lives and is a member of the Night&#8217;s Watch, an institution of which
        Eddard is a keen supporter. He also appeared to have troubles keeping his bannermen in
        line as Stannis Baratheon remembered his brother, Robert, saying the Northmen were
        difficult to control, even with Eddard on his side. \n\n Eddard wields a Valyrian
        greatsword named Ice (an heirloom of House Stark) which he uses on ceremonial
        occasions.</string>

    <string name="background_character_stark_catelyn">Catelyn was born into House Tully and is the
        eldest child of Lord Hoster Tully. She has a younger brother, Edmure, and a younger sister,
        Lysa. Petyr Baelish was fostered with the Tullys and Catelyn grew up with him. She was
        betrothed to marry Brandon Stark of Winterfell, but he was brutally murdered by the Mad
        King, Aerys II Targaryen after Prince Rhaegar had kidnapped Brandon&#8217;s sister Lyanna.
        Catelyn instead married Brandon&#8217;s brother, Eddard. Though they barely knew one another when
        they wed they have formed a strong and loving marriage. \n\n Catelyn and Eddard have five
        children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. She is unhappy with Eddard&#8217;s bastard son Jon
        Snow living with her family in Winterfell, the only source of friction between her and her
        husband. \n\n Catelyn has some independent political influence. A former ward of her
        father&#8217;s, Petyr Baelish, known as &#8220;Littlefinger&#8221;, is the king&#8217;s master of coin and one of
        his closest advisers in King&#8217;s Landing. \n\n Catelyn says that she hasn&#8217;t been to the
        capital city of King&#8217;s Landing since nine years before her husband went there to be the
        new Hand of the King, which would be around the time of the Greyjoy Rebellion.</string>

        from their seat of Winterfell. Eddard is also the Warden of the North to King Robert
        Baratheon. \n\n Robb was born at Riverrun and raised in Winterfell. His father left his
        mother the morning after their wedding to fight in Robert&#8217;s Rebellion and did not return
        until after Robb was born. He has two younger trueborn brothers, Bran and Rickon, and two
        sisters, Sansa and Arya. He is also close to his bastard half-brother, Jon Snow, and to
        his father&#8217;s ward, Theon Greyjoy, whom he counts as his best friend outside of the family.
        He has been trained from childhood to wield a sword and wear armor by Winterfell&#8217;s
        Master-at-Arms Ser Rodrik Cassel, and is highly proficient with both for his young age.
        He lives at Winterfell with his family.</string>

        She has an older brother, Robb, two younger brothers, Bran and Rickon, a younger sister,
        Arya and a bastard half-brother, Jon Snow. Sansa enjoys proper &#8220;lady-like&#8221; pursuits, and is
        good at sewing, embroidering, poetry, singing, dancing, literature and music. She dreams of
        being a regal Queen like Cersei Lannister, and that just like in the epic songs she will
        meet her knight in shining armor. She has inherited her mother&#8217;s Tully coloring, unlike
        most of her siblings, and Lady Catelyn thinks Sansa will be even more beautiful than she
        was when she was younger. She is often seen in contrast with her sister, Arya Stark who
        has neither her looks nor her accomplishments in feminine activities and
        comportment.</string>

        She has an older sister, Sansa Stark. She also has an older brother, Robb, two younger
        brothers, Bran and Rickon and a bastard half-brother, Jon Snow. \n\n Arya rejects the
        notion that she must become a lady and marry for influence and power, feeling she can
        forge her own destiny. She is fascinated by warfare and training in the use of arms, and
        is bored by embroidery and other &#8220;lady-like&#8221; pursuits. She takes after her father and has
        a quarrelsome relationship with her sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and
        personalities. She is close to her half-brother Jon, who is also something of an
        outcast.</string>

        Edmure Tully, and Lysa Arryn. Brynden is a respected knight and formidable battle
        commander, who first distinguished himself in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, nearly forty
        years before the War of the Five Kings. \n\n Brynden often argued with his older brother
        Hoster, particularly over the fact that Brynden never married. When Brynden returned home
        from the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Hoster had already arranged for him to marry Bethany
        Redwyne, of the wealthy and powerful House Redwyne. Brynden refused this generous match,
        however, refusing to be told when and whom to marry. Hoster was angry that Brynden would
        not do his duty to their family and enter into a marriage-alliance to improve their
        fortunes, and said that he was the black goat of the Tully herd. Brynden joked that given
        that the Tully sigil is a trout, it would be more fitting to say that he was the &#8220;black
        fish&#8221; of the Tully school. The nickname stuck, and Ser Brynden became popularly known as
        &#8220;The Blackfish&#8221; ever since. Brynden even took to using a black fish in his own personal
        heraldry: like the standard Tully heraldry it uses a red and blue background, but swaps
        out the normal silver trout for a black one. Hoster would attempt to contract other
        arranged marriage-alliances for Brynden over the years, many of them very promising
        matches, but Brynden turned down them all, which led to constant bickering between the
        two brothers throughout their lives. \n\n Despite his disagreements with his brother over
        his refusal to marry, Brynden is very devoted to his family.</string>

    <!-- Character Tywin Lannister -->
    <string name="title_character_lannister_tywin">Tywin Lannister</string>
    <string name="background_character_lannister_tywin">Tywin is the lord of House Lannister, the
        Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, and the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms. The
        Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister
        is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Lannister rule the region from their seat
        of Casterly Rock and Tywin also holds the title Lord of Casterly Rock. He is also the
        Warden of the West. He is a widower with three children, Jaime, Cersei and Tyrion.​
        Casterly Rock, the Lannister&#8217;s ancestral seat of power, is located over a group of highly
        productive goldmines, which have provided the Lannisters with immense wealth over the years
        and led to the speculation that Tywin &#8220;shits gold.&#8221; \n\n Tywin is the son of Tytos
        Lannister. His father presided over a period of decline for the house, frittering away
        much of their fortune on poor investments and allowing himself to be mocked at court,
        creating a perception of weakness. Their vassals House Reyne of Castamere rebelled against
        Lord Tytos, and Tywin put down the rebellion personally, extinguishing their house and
        re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister. His ruthless destruction of
        House Reyne was immortalized in the song &#8220;The Rains of Castamere&#8221; and gave darker meaning
        to the common phrase &#8220;A Lannister always pays his debts,&#8221; which originally referred solely
        to the Lannister&#8217;s vast fortune. \n\n Tywin married his cousin Joanna Lannister and their
        first children were the fraternal twins Cersei and Jaime. She died after giving birth to
        Tyrion, which Tywin has blamed his son for ever since. When Jaime was diagnosed with a
        learning difficulty by a Maester who predicted that he would never read, Tywin sat with
        his son for four hours a day until he overcame his problems with transposing letters in
        his mind, much to Jaime&#8217;s resentment. Tywin despises and hates his younger son, seeing him
        as misshapen and perverse. When Tyrion was very young, Jaime set him up with a prostitute.
        Jaime posed her as a common girl in distress that they rescued from bandits. Jaime chased
        the bandits off while Tyrion comforted the girl. They married, but when Tywin found out he
        was furious and made Jaime reveal the truth. Tywin paid her for every one of his guards to
        have sex with her and forced Tyrion to watch. Tyrion&#8217;s hatred of Tywin has been
        reciprocated since. Nevertheless, all of Tywin&#8217;s children are in awe of him and heed his
        counsel. \n\n Tywin served as Hand of the King to Aerys II Targaryen for twenty years until
        the Mad King, driven by envy and distrust, rejected Tywin&#8217;s proposal to marry his daughter
        Cersei to Prince Rhaegar and made his son Jaime a member of the Kingsguard. As members of
        the Kingsguard are forbidden to marry, Aerys had effectively robbed Tywin of his heir,
        which Tywin perceived as a great insult and resigned. During Robert&#8217;s Rebellion Tywin
        remained neutral, answering neither the summons of the King nor the calls from the rebels,
        until the Battle of the Trident, after which it became clear that the rebels would win.
        Tywin marched with the full power of Casterly Rock to the capital, feigning that he had
        come to defend it from the rebellion. Aerys&#8217; advisors urged the King not to trust Tywin,
        even Jaime Lannister, who knew his father would never back the losing side in a war.
        Nevertheless, on Pycelle&#8217;s advice, the gates were opened to the Lannister army. Tywin
        ordered the city to be taken and the royal family eliminated in a quick and efficient
        manner; as a result the city was sacked and the royal family massacred by Ser Gregor
        Clegane. Upon seeing Tywin&#8217;s betrayal, Aerys ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin&#8217;s head and
        instructed his royal pyromancer to set King&#8217;s Landing ablaze. Jaime responded by
        personally stabbing the Mad King in the back. When Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark
        reached the Red Keep, Tywin presented the bodies of the royal family as proof of his
        allegiance. After the rebellion Robert Baratheon took the throne and married Tywin&#8217;s
        daughter Cersei to cement the alliance between their houses. \n\n Cersei gave birth to
        three children--Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen Baratheon. Unbeknownst to Tywin all three
        children are the product of her incestuous relationship with Jaime. This was discovered by
        both Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, albeit independently, and meant that Joffrey—the oldest
        of the Baratheon children and the heir apparent to the Iron Throne—had no actual claim to
        the throne. Tywin is close to his younger brother, Kevan who is his chief advisor, and
        Kevan&#8217;s son Lancel was King Robert&#8217;s squire, and many secretly believe Lancel gave Robert
        too much wine during his fatal hunt on Cersei&#8217;s orders.</string>

        child of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister. Tywin is the head of House Lannister,

        are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the
        Great Houses of the realm. Cersei is the elder twin of Ser Jaime Lannister and the elder
        sister of Tyrion Lannister. She was raised in privilege in the family seat of Casterly Rock.
        She is noted for her great beauty. \n\n Cersei&#8217;s mother died when she was four years old,
        after giving birth to her younger brother Tyrion. Like her father, Cersei has always blamed
        Tyrion for her mother&#8217;s death and deeply resents that her mother died so that Tyrion would
        be brought into the world. Cersei&#8217;s father Tywin was constantly away from home during her
        childhood and teenaged years, serving as Hand of the King at the capital, with only
        infrequent visits back to his seat at Casterly Rock. Coupled with the death of her mother,
        this meant that Cersei and her two brothers were primarily raised by servants attached to
        House Lannister. She began an incestuous relationship with Jaime in her youth which has
        continued despite her marriage. Cersei has had other partners but Jaime has always been
        faithful to her. \n\n When she was about fifteen, Cersei and her friend Melara visited
        Maggy, a woods witch and reputed fortune teller dwelling in a hut deep in a forest close to
        Casterly Rock. Melara was reluctant, but Cersei convinced her to go. After rudely awakening
        her and insisting on having her future foretold, Maggy tasted a drop of her blood and
        revealed to Cersei she wouldn&#8217;t marry &#8220;the Prince&#8221; but &#8220;the King&#8221;, and while the king would
        have twenty sons, she would bear only three children who will wear golden crowns as well as
        golden shrouds. Finally, she revealed to Cersei that although she would indeed be Queen,
        she would be cast down by another, younger and more beautiful queen. \n\n After the end of
        the civil war which ended the reign of House Targaryen, Cersei was married to King Robert
        Baratheon, a political marriage Robert agreed to in thanks for her father&#8217;s last-minute
        alliance. She was only 19 when she married Robert and became Queen. At first, Cersei
        was infatuated with the handsome Robert, but their love begun to wane when he called her
        &#8220;Lyanna&#8221; on their wedding night. She nevertheless bore Robert a son who died shortly
        after his birth. Cersei was devastated by her son&#8217;s loss and refused to have the body taken
        from her, forcing Robert to hold her while they took her son from her. In time, Cersei&#8217;s
        feelings for Robert turned to hatred and she returned to her brother as a result. Her three
        children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen, are officially Robert&#8217;s, but in reality are the
        products of her incestuous relationship with Jaime.</string>

    <!-- Character Jaime Lannister -->
    <string name="title_character_lannister_jaime">Jaime Lannister</string>
    <string name="background_character_lannister_jaime">Ser Jaime Lannister is a knight of the
        Kingsguard, a position he has held for twenty years since he was a teenager, the youngest
        man ever appointed to its membership. He was appointed to the position by the Mad King,
        Aerys II Targaryen. \n\n At the conclusion of Robert&#8217;s Rebellion, Jaime&#8217;s father Tywin
        arrived at the gates of King&#8217;s Landing with the main Lannister army, pledging his
        allegiance. Most of the Small Council urged Aerys not to trust Tywin, especially Jamie,
        knowing his father would never support the losing side of a war. Instead, Grand Maester
        Pycelle gave the opposite counsel, and once the Lannister army was allowed inside, Tywin
        ordered his men to attack the city. As Lannister soldiers raped and pillaged throughout the
        city during the Sack of King&#8217;s Landing, King Aerys remained holed up inside the Red Keep,
        for hours maniacally repeating the order to &#8220;burn them all&#8221;. Despite being sworn by the
        holiest oaths to protect the king as a member of the Kingsguard, Jaime ultimately turned
        his own sword on Aerys, slaying him at the foot of the Iron Throne itself. For this
        infamous act, he is known throughout the Seven Kingdoms as the &#8220;Kingslayer&#8221;, to his
        irritation. \n\n Jaime always refused to discuss precisely what happened the day he slew
        the Mad King, and thus his true motivations– and what plans Aerys had for King&#8217;s Landing–
        were never revealed. On one occasion he confides the truth to Brienne of Tarth: Aerys&#8217;
        final orders were for Jaime to kill his father, and to burn the entire city and its
        inhabitants with wildfire. Unwilling to let that happen, Jaime killed him, and in doing so
        actually saved thousands of innocent lives. He adds that the &#8220;honorable&#8221; Ned Stark judged
        him guilty on the spot, without giving Jamie a chance to explain. \n\n He was forgiven for
        breaking his vows by King Robert Baratheon and permitted to remain in the Kingsguard as
        part of Robert&#8217;s alliance with House Lannister, along with the marriage of Jaime&#8217;s twin
        sister Cersei to Robert. In addition to the slaying of the Mad King, Jaime is known for
        his handsome looks, arrogant demeanor, and superb martial skills. He is so skilled with
        a sword that he claims that there are only three men in the seven kingdoms who may have a
        chance at beating him in a fair duel. \n\n Jaime is the eldest son of Joanna Lannister and
        Lord Tywin Lannister. Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven
        Kingdoms and Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent
        regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm.
        Jaime had great difficulty learning to read as a child because he transposed letters in his
        mind. Tywin sat with him through four hours a day practicing until he learnt. Jaime
        resented being forced to spend so much time on reading. \n\n Jaime is the older brother of
        Tyrion and the twin brother of Cersei. Their mother died giving birth to Tyrion. Due to his
        place in the Kingsguard, Jaime cannot inherit his father&#8217;s lands or titles, making Tyrion
        his father&#8217;s heir; a fact which vexes Tywin. Unlike Cersei and Tywin, Jaime always treated
        Tyrion with a degree of kindness and respect. In a secret known to only a few, Jaime is
        Cersei&#8217;s lover and the biological father of her children, Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen,
        whom the world believes are Robert&#8217;s kin.</string>

    <!-- Character Tyrion Lannister -->
    <string name="title_character_lannister_tyrion">Tyrion Lannister</string>
    <string name="background_character_lannister_tyrion">Tyrion Lannister is the youngest son of
        Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister. Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the
        richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands
        are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister of Casterly
        Rock is one of the Great Houses of the realm. He is the younger brother of Jaime and Cersei
        Lannister. His mother Joanna Lannister died giving birth to him. His father and sister hold
        him in contempt as they blame him for the death. \n\n He is a dwarf, causing him problems
        and persecution. His size has led him to being referred to derisively by various names,
        such as &#8220;The Imp&#8221; and &#8220;The Halfman&#8221;. This is mitigated by his intellect and his family&#8217;s
        wealth and power. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion been born a commoner, he&#8217;d have
        simply been left out in the woods to die. However, Tyrion was born into a powerful noble
        House, and was therefore spared. Even though his father doesn&#8217;t think much of him, he has
        had the benefits of being raised with wealth and education, and is expected to lead his
        life as a credit to the Lannister name. He is committed to the good of both his House
        and, since Cersei married King Robert Baratheon, his family&#8217;s continued hold on the throne.
        \n\n When Tyrion was 16, he met a wheelwright&#8217;s daughter named Tysha on the road,
        apparently the victim of an attempted rape. While his brother Jaime ran off the attackers,
        Tyrion helped Tysha recover from the ordeal, and they became lovers. They found a drunken,
        wandering septon willing to marry them and briefly, they lived as husband and wife. That
        is, until Lord Tywin learned what had happened. Jaime confessed that he organized the
        incident to make his brother happy, and Tysha was actually a prostitute. As a lesson, Tywin
        gave Tysha to his guards, paying her a silver coin for each man and forcing Tyrion to watch.
        By the end, there were so many silver coins that they were running out of her hands onto
        the ground. Tyrion has reciprocated Tywin&#8217;s hatred ever since. \n\n His two siblings have
        had positions of respect and responsibility since their teens. When Tyrion turned sixteen
        (the age of manhood), Tywin Lannister put Tyrion in charge of the drains and cisterns at
        Casterly Rock. Tyrion brags that the &#8220;[sewage] never flowed [smoother] to the sea.&#8221; \n\n
        Tyrion once encountered Lord Gregor Forrester at the Tourney in Lannisport. While they once
        spoke briefly, Tyrion found Gregor very honorable, even mentioning it to Gregor&#8217;s daughter
        Mira years later. \n\n Tyrion spends a lot of time at court in King&#8217;s Landing to avoid his
        father. He gets on well with Jaime and his niece Myrcella and nephew Tommen, but has a
        colder relationship with Cersei and his sadistic nephew Joffrey. He has a fondness for
        prostitutes and drink, but is also intelligent, cunning, and educated. He also is a kind
        man who would protect the innocent claiming that he loves broken things.</string>

    <!-- Character Joffrey Baratheon -->
    <string name="title_character_baratheon_joffrey">Joffrey Baratheon</string>
    <string name="background_character_baratheon_joffrey">Joffrey is believed to be the oldest son
        and heir of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, both of whom entered into a
        political marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the Mad King Aerys
        II Targaryen. In reality, his father is Jaime Lannister, the queen&#8217;s brother and the Lord
        Commander of the Kingsguard. He has a younger sister, Myrcella, and a younger brother,
        Tommen , both whom are also the product of Jaime and Cersei&#8217;s incest. Their sole biological
        grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also apparently first cousins. \n\n Joffrey
        takes after his mother in terms of looks and personality, his blonde hair being a subtle
        clue that he isn&#8217;t really a Baratheon, who famously always possess black hair even when
        one of their parents possesses blonde hair. (Cersei herself lets it slip to Catelyn Stark
        that she once had a child with black hair who died prematurely before she had Joffrey.) He
        is usually accompanied by his sworn shield, the formidable Sandor Clegane, better known as
        the Hound. Even before he ascends to the Iron Throne, Joffrey is spoiled, arrogant,
        cowardly, and sadistic; however these traits are further exacerbated upon Robert&#8217;s death
        and his ascension to the crown.</string>

    <!-- Character Myrcella Baratheon -->
    <string name="title_character_baratheon_myrcella">Myrcella Baratheon</string>
    <string name="background_character_baratheon_myrcella">Princess Myrcella was commonly thought
        to be the only daughter of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. Cersei and
        Robert married to seal a political alliance between House Baratheon and House Lannister
        after Robert took the throne by force from the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen. Myrcella had an
        older brother, Joffrey, and a younger, Tommen, with whom she was close. The real father of
        all three children is Jaime Lannister, her uncle (Cersei&#8217;s twin brother) and a member of
        the Kingsguard, making them bastards born of incest. However, like her siblings and the
        rest of Westeros, Myrcella had no idea of the truth of her parentage at the time. She had a
        sweet and quiet disposition and was fond of her uncle Tyrion Lannister.</string>

    <string name="background_character_baratheon_tommen">Tommen is presented as the youngest son of
        King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. Cersei and Robert made a political
        marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the Mad King Aerys II
        Targaryen. Tommen&#8217;s real father is Jaime Lannister, his mother&#8217;s twin brother and his uncle.
        \n\n He has an older brother, Joffrey, and an older sister Myrcella with the same
        obfuscated parentage. Tommen is good-natured and passive in contrast to his brother
        Joffrey, who sometimes bullied Tommen for amusement. Like his sister, he is fond of his
        uncle Tyrion.</string>

        and Lord of Casterly Rock. Kevan is married to Dorna Lannister and they have a son Lancel,
        who is a squire to King Robert Baratheon. He is a noted knight who served his elder brother

    <string name="background_character_bronn">Bronn is a sellsword; a mercenary soldier whose
        service as a warrior is for hire. Not much is known about his past or family. Both his
        parents beat him, and his nose was accidentally broken when his mother hit him with
        kitchenware, which she had meant for Bronn&#8217;s younger brother. When Tyrion Lannister
        introduced him to Tywin Lannister, Bronn said that his father is no one Lord Tywin would
        know. During a drinking game with Tyrion and Shae, Bronn claims that he killed a woman
        before he was 12 years old, though it was in self-defense as she was attacking him with an
        axe. Bronn also confirmed Tyrion&#8217;s claim that Bronn has been beyond the Wall. When asked
        why he was there, he bluntly answers that it was &#8220;work&#8221;.</string>

    <string name="background_character_qyburn">Qyburn is a former maester of the Citadel. He was
        stripped of his chain by the Archmaesters for engaging in forbidden human experimentation:
        it was discovered that he had been vivisecting living men in his pursuit of medical
        knowledge. Qyburn held to the belief that the death of a few men was justifiable if it
        would lead to medical breakthroughs that would save the lives of many more. \n\n While his
        unethical experiments have led to him being reviled, they also made him arguably one of
        the most talented healers in all of Westeros.</string>

    <!-- Character Pycelle -->
    <string name="title_character_pycelle">Pycelle</string>
    <string name="background_character_pycelle">Pycelle has been Grand Maester of the Seven
        Kingdoms for decades and has served under four kings when the series begins. The Grand
        Maester is the King&#8217;s personal maester, a learned man wise in history, science and
        medicine who also provides counsel. The Grand Maester sits on the King&#8217;s small council,
        which runs the realm in the name of the King. He served King Aerys II Targaryen prior to
        Robert&#8217;s Rebellion. He remembers Aerys as a great man before his descent into madness.
        When Tywin Lannister marched to the gates of King&#8217;s Landing following the rebel victory at
        the Battle of the Trident and all of the King&#8217;s advisors told Aerys not to trust the Lord
        of Casterly Rock, Pycelle gave the opposite counsel and the city gates were opened,
        allowing the Lannister forces to sack the capital. \n\n Following the rebellion he remained
        Grand Maester to King Robert Baratheon. He is joined on the small council by the Master of C
        oin Petyr Baelish, also called Littlefinger, the Master of Whisperers Varys, the Master of
        Ships Stannis Baratheon and the Master of Laws Renly Baratheon. He plays up his age to
        appear harmless but is actually mentally sharp and dangerous. He is loyal to Queen Cersei
        Lannister and was involved in the birth of all of her children, assisted by midwives.
        Pycelle also privately flouts the vow of celibacy taken by maesters, as he enjoys the
        company of prostitutes such as Ros. Despite his tendency for deception, he does retain some
        sense of medical ethics, as he found Qyburn&#8217;s methods abhorrent.</string>

    <!-- Character Petyr Baelish -->
    <string name="title_character_baelish_petyr">Petyr Baelish</string>
    <string name="background_character_baelish_petyr">Petyr Baelish is the head of House Baelish,
        and the lord of an extremely minor holding, so small it has neither name nor maester,
        located in a small area within the Fingers, a coastal region in the northeastern shores of
        the Vale of Arryn. He is currently House Baelish&#8217;s only living member. \n\n House Baelish
        had very meager origins and no distinguished lineage: Petyr&#8217;s great-grandfather was a
        lowly sellsword from Braavos who came to the Vale at the invitation of House Corbray.
        Petyr&#8217;s grandfather was a poor hedge knight, who managed to earn a minor lordship of a few
        stony acres in the smallest peninsula of the Fingers. \n\n Petyr&#8217;s father fought in the War
        of the Ninepenny Kings, the preemptive assault on the forces of Maelys Blackfyre, the last
        of the Blackfyre Pretenders, before they could attempt an invasion of Westeros. During the
        conflict Petyr&#8217;s father served well under Lord Hoster Tully. Through their good
        relationship Hoster agreed to foster his son Petyr at Riverrun, a great honor for a lesser
        House. \n\n Petyr went to Riverrun when he was eight years old, carrying all he owned in a
        bundle. At Riverrun he befriended Hoster&#8217;s daughters Catelyn and Lysa Tully. Their brother
        Edmure mockingly nicknamed him &#8220;Littlefinger&#8221; at the time, in reference to his small height
        at the time and the location of his minor landholdings. The nickname would stick with him
        throughout his life. Eventually even Petyr sarcastically embraced the nickname, due to the
        fact that it demonstrated how far he had risen, from an impoverished noble-born boy from an
        insignificant minor House in the &#8220;little Finger&#8221; peninsula of the Vale, to one of the most
        powerful officials at the royal court. \n\n Petyr became smitten with Catelyn but she never
        returned his affections. Lysa was infatuated with Petyr, but he only loved Catelyn.
        Eventually when she was betrothed to Brandon Stark, heir to Lord of Winterfell and Lord
        Paramount of the North, Petyr challenged him to a duel, thinking he could win through pluck
        and courage - he was promptly overpowered and nearly killed, though Catelyn begged Brandon
        to spare his life. Embittered, Petyr was cast out of Riverrun and returned to the Vale.
        During the course of Robert&#8217;s Rebellion, however, Brandon was killed by the Mad King Aerys
        II Targaryen, so Catelyn married his younger brother Eddard Stark, while to secure a
        political alliance Lysa was wed to Jon Arryn, ruler of the Vale. Manipulating Lysa&#8217;s
        infatuation with himself, Petyr ingratiated himself into Jon&#8217;s services, first as customs
        officer at Gulltown, where he increased the port&#8217;s revenues tenfold. Seeing Littlefinger&#8217;s
        financial acumen, Jon was easily convinced by Lysa to later bring Littlefinger to the royal
        court at King&#8217;s Landing, and make him Master of Coin on King Robert Baratheon&#8217;s Small
        Council. Baelish&#8217;s naked ambition often placed him at odds with the Master of Whisperers,
        Lord Varys. In charge of the crown&#8217;s treasury, Littlefinger rapidly grew into a powerful
        player in royal politics and a master of court intrigues. Of an older mindset, few who did
        not know him suspected Littlefinger as a threat, seeing only that he was a man from a very
        minor House, with no distinguished lineage, significant landholdings, or armies. Instead,
        Littlefinger based his newfound power on money. Baelish is unscrupulous in his search
        for power and wealth: he has bought multiple brothels in the city - particularly a high
        class brothel catering to the nobles in the city - cynically noting that whores make a
        better investment than ships, because they rarely sink. Baelish makes good use of his
        brothels to have his agents spy on and manipulate his clientele, and owns one of the
        largest spy networks in Westeros - second only to Varys&#8217;s. Littlefinger has been known to
        privately bribe lords who have unusual or violent sexual fetishes if they pay the right
        price - ranging from supplying lords with amputee prostitutes, to delivering young boys to
        pederasts, and even delivering prostitutes to be secretly murdered by his clients for
        thrill-kills. \n\n Due to their past friendship as children, Catelyn Stark continued to
        believe that Lord Baelish was a friend she could count on at court.</string>

    <!-- Character Varys -->
    <string name="title_character_varys">Varys</string>
    <string name="background_character_varys">Varys was born across the Narrow Sea in Lys. He was
        born a slave, and as a child he traveled with a troupe of actors all around the different
        Free Cities until a sorcerer in the city of Myr made an offer Varys&#8217;s master couldn&#8217;t
        refuse. Varys was sold to the sorcerer, who gave him a potion that made him unable to move
        or speak but didn&#8217;t dull his perceptions or sense of pain, and emasculated him (cutting off
        his testes and penis both) so he could use his sexual organs in a magical ritual, burning
        them in a brazier. When the sorcerer had thrown Varys&#8217;s genitals in the brazier, the fire
        turned blue and a voice replied back. Afterward, the sorcerer had no more use for Varys and
        threw him in the streets to die. Instead, Varys resolved to live no matter what: begging,
        stealing, and selling the sexual use of what parts remained to him, doing anything to
        survive. He also became an excellent thief, but soon learned that stolen information was
        often a far more valuable commodity than any physical goods, and he worked his way up from
        the slums of Myr. He became a master spy and information trafficker, and his influence and
        reputation grew so great that he eventually found himself as a member of the Small Council
        in the Seven Kingdoms. His experience at the hands of the sorcerer had also left him with
        a bitter hatred for magic and its practitioners. \n\n As a member of the King&#8217;s Small
        Council, he serves as the Master of Whisperers, the King&#8217;s foremost spymaster and
        intelligence agent. He holds no inherited title, castle, or lands in Westeros, but is
        called &#8220;Lord&#8221; as a courtesy due to his position on the council, which traditionally is
        made up of high lords. \n\n When the Mad King arrested Brandon Stark for threatening Prince
        Rhaegar, Varys and the rest of the Small Council urged the King to pardon Brandon on the
        grounds that he was the heir to Winterfell and the Prince had abducted his sister. However,
        the King refused to heed their advice and had both Brandon and his father brutally
        executed. This led to a rebellion that ultimately toppled the Targaryen dynasty. \n\n When
        the Mad King&#8217;s former Hand Tywin Lannister arrived at King&#8217;s Landing with the entire
        Lannister army at his back, professing loyalty to his beleaguered King after the rebels&#8217;
        resounding victory at the Battle of the Trident, Varys warned Aerys not to open the gates,
        as did Tywin&#8217;s own son in the Kingsguard, Jaime Lannister. However, Grand Maester Pycelle
        told Aerys what he wanted to hear: that he could trust Lord Tywin. So Aerys opened the
        gates and Tywin sacked the city, and Jaime wound up stabbing Aerys in the back. \n\n Despite
        his previous loyalty to the Targaryens, Varys was pardoned by the new King Robert Baratheon
        and allowed to keep his position on the Small Council under the advice of his Hand, Jon
        Arryn. \n\n Varys is bald and tends towards fat, due to his castration. He often puts on
        the public persona of being nothing more than a pudgy man well suited to the pleasantries
        of court life; humble, obsequious, fawning, and a little effeminate. This is simply a
        facade that Varys has developed, which often leads those who do not know him well to
        underestimate him as a cheerful and vapid flatterer. In reality he is a cunning and
        ruthless manipulator of court politics, on-par with Master of Coin Petyr &#8220;Littlefinger&#8221;
        Baelish, with whom he frequently spars. Unlike Baelish, Varys insists that his goals are
        to achieve what he honestly feels is best for the realm, though of course, what he and the
        current King feel is best might be two separate things. \n\n He is disparagingly known as
        &#8220;The Spider&#8221; due to his vast web of intelligence sources. His sophisticated intelligence
        network - one of the largest in the world - spans both Westeros and Essos, as far as Vaes
        Dothrak and even Qarth. He refers to his agents and sources of information- many of which
        are low-born children- as his &#8220;little birds&#8221;. Unlike Baelish, however, Varys is not
        indifferent or cruel towards his employees; he educates them and provides them with
        protection in return for the information they bring him. \n\n One of his jobs is to keep an
        eye on the movements of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen and ensure they do not become a

        of the realm. Margaery was raised in privilege in the family seat and regional capital of
        Highgarden. She is close to her brother, Ser Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers. She is

        The Reach is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Tyrell is one
        of the Great Houses of the realm. Loras was raised in privilege in the family seat and
        regional capital of Highgarden. Loras is the heir to Highgarden and the Tyrell lands and
        titles, and this status, along with his skills and good looks, makes him possibly the most
        sought-after bachelor in all of Westeros. \n\n Loras is a skilled knight famed for his many
        tournament victories and his good looks, which make him popular with the smallfolk and with
        young women in particular. Loras is one of the few knights who has on rare occasion managed
        to defeat the formidable Jaime Lannister in a joust. He is commonly known as the &#8220;Knight of
        the Flowers&#8221;, as a rose is the sigil of House Tyrell and he thus wears armor elaborately
        engraved with flowers. \n\n Loras is the former squire of Lord Renly Baratheon and remains
        Renly&#8217;s close friend and lover. When the series begins Loras is in King&#8217;s Landing primarily
        to compete in tourneys and attend court.</string>

        Tyrell and the mother of Mace Tyrell, the current Lord of Highgarden, Warden of the South,
        Lord Paramount of the Reach, and head of House Tyrell. She is the grandmother of his
        children Loras and Margaery. She was born into House Redwyne, one of the most prominent and
        powerful vassals of House Tyrell. \n\n In her youth, Olenna Redwyne was engaged to a member
        of House Targaryen, as it was &#8220;all the rage&#8221; at the time; it was her sister Viola whom
        Luthor Tyrell was expected to marry. The night before Luthor was to propose to Viola,
        Olenna snuck into his chamber and seduced him, leaving him &#8220;unable to walk downstairs&#8221;
        the next day to propose to Viola. Olenna did this because the thought of marrying a
        Targaryen and his &#8220;ludicrous silver hair&#8221; did not appeal to her. \n\n Although Olenna
        consistently referred to Luthor as an oaf, she was genuinely fond of him, and confided
        to Margaery that she had some difficulty accepting his death after his body was delivered
        to her.</string>

    <!-- Character Mace Tyrell -->
    <string name="title_character_tyrell_mace">Mace Tyrell</string>
    <string name="background_character_tyrell_mace">Mace Tyrell is the Lord of Highgarden and head
        of House Tyrell, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. He is the Lord Paramount of the Reach
        and Warden of the South. The Tyrells are one of the richest and most powerful families in
        Westeros, second only to the Lannisters - for while the mountains of the Westerlands
        possess rich gold mines, the fields of The Reach are the most fertile in Westeros, capable
        of supporting armies almost twice the size of any other kingdom. \n\n Mace is not
        considered a great strategist or general himself - his own mother Olenna openly describes
        him as an oaf. On the other hand, he has shown good judgment in delegating such tasks to
        trusted, skilled subordinates, such as the famous general Randyll Tarly, who often commands
        Mace&#8217;s forces in battle. \n\n Mace might not be the most intelligent man, but he is an
        amiable fellow well-liked by most of his bannermen, as well a loving husband and father.
        Mace has one son, Loras, and a daughter, Margaery, arguably the most eligible woman in the
        Seven Kingdoms. Mace hopes to make a good match for her to increase the already
        considerable power and influence of his family. Mace is particularly eager for Margaery to
        secure a royal marriage for their family because unlike some of the other Great Houses of
        the Seven Kingdoms such as the Starks or Lannisters, the Tyrells never ruled as kings in
        their own right, but were granted control of the Reach as a reward for submitting to Aegon
        the Conqueror during the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago. Thus entering into the
        royal bloodline would increase House Tyrell&#8217;s prestige and secure their rule over their
        fractious vassals in the Reach. \n\n During Robert&#8217;s Rebellion, Mace and House Tyrell
        stayed loyal to House Targaryen. The Tyrells owed their rule over Highgarden and the Reach
        to the Targaryen kings, who after the Targaryen Conquest three centuries before had awarded
        rule of the Reach to the Tyrells ahead of other families from the region which actually had
        better claims (such as House Florent). The Tyrell armies were able to inflict the only
        defeat that Robert Baratheon suffered during the entire war at the Battle of Ashford.
        Afterwards, Mace&#8217;s massive army moved east to lay siege to the mighty castle-seat of the
        Baratheons, Storm&#8217;s End. The Siege of Storm&#8217;s End lasted the better part of a year, while
        Mace and his commanders feasted in sight of the starving garrison led by Robert&#8217;s younger
        brother Stannis. Ultimately Stannis&#8217;s determined defense held, and the siege only succeeded
        in pinning down Mace&#8217;s army and preventing it from assisting the Targaryens in the
        climactic battles occurring further north. After the Sack of King&#8217;s Landing, Eddard Stark
        rode south with the main rebel army to relieve the siege. With the capital city in rebel
        hands, and both Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and his father Mad King Aerys dead, Mace saw that
        the war was clearly lost and gave no battle to Lord Eddard. Instead he peacefully dipped
        his banners and submitted to Robert&#8217;s rule, and in return was treated leniently, pardoned,
        and allowed to continue ruling the Reach as his family had before the war. However, ever
        since there was never any great love between Mace Tyrell and Stannis Baratheon.</string>

        family is famous for flaying the skin from their enemies as a means of torture and
        execution. Roose fought for Lord Eddard Stark in the civil war against House Targaryen
        known as Robert&#8217;s Rebellion and proved his worth as a soldier in the Battle of the Trident.
        He advised Robert Baratheon to execute Ser Barristan Selmy, a legendary Kingsguard sworn to
        the Targaryens, but Robert overruled Roose and pardoned Selmy. \n\n Roose Bolton had a

        discovered that a miller had wed without his permission. He had the miller hanged and
        raped his wife. Ramsay was born shortly afterwards, and his mother brought him to the
        Dreadfort, his father&#8217;s castle, for Roose to acknowledge as his son. Roose very nearly
        killed both Ramsay and his mother, but relented upon realizing that the child was indeed
        his. \n\n Ramsay is Roose&#8217;s only living child following the death of Domeric Bolton, as
        well as the only possible heir to House Bolton until the birth of a child by Roose&#8217;s new
        wife, Fat Walda Frey. He stayed behind as castellan of the Dreadfort when his father left
        for the south to fight in the War of the Five Kings. \n\n Ramsay keeps a pack of dogs,
        which he employs for hunting. He is also in a relationship with the kennelmaster&#8217;s

        crushed in a war led by King Robert Baratheon and Lord Eddard Stark. Theon&#8217;s brothers were
        both killed in the fighting. Balon surrendered and was allowed to remain Lord of the Iron
        Islands on the condition that Theon remain a hostage and ward of Eddard Stark. Theon&#8217;s
        sister Yara remained on the Iron Islands. Despite his status as a hostage at Winterfell,
        Theon was treated well by the Starks, and he came to see Eddard as a surrogate father,
        while becoming best friends with Robb Stark. Theon is a skilled archer. His cocky arrogance

        Baratheon and Cassana Baratheon, and has two younger brothers, Renly and Stannis. Steffon
        was the head of House Baratheon and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The Stormlands are
        one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Baratheon is one of the
        Great Houses of the realm. His parents died in his youth when their ship was caught in a
        storm; Robert, standing on the walls of Storm&#8217;s End with Stannis, witnessed his parents
        ship that was returning from Essos break up on the rocks. He inherited the lordship, and
        was fostered by Jon Arryn, the head of House Arryn, another Great House. Eddard Stark, the
        second son of House Stark, was also fostered by Jon Arryn and Robert and Eddard became as
        close as brothers. \n\n Robert served King Aerys II Targaryen (known as the Mad King) as
        the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. Robert was betrothed to Lyanna Stark, Eddard&#8217;s sister.
        Lyanna was kidnapped by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. \n\n The mad king had Eddard&#8217;s father and
        brother killed for protesting against the kidnapping. Their deaths sparked a massive
        uprising against Aerys led by Robert, Eddard and Jon Arryn. Lyanna and Aerys died during
        the civil war that followed. Robert claimed the Iron Throne because he started the war and
        killed Prince Rhaegar personally. Robert also had the best claim to the throne as a result
        of being related to the Targaryens through his paternal grandmother, Rhaelle Targaryen. The
        other leaders of the rebels, Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, believed that Robert, with his
        claim and charismatic personality, should be king and both stood aside. \n\n Robert was
        devastated by Lyanna&#8217;s death, but was urged by Jon Arryn to marry Cersei of House Lannister,
        making an alliance with her father, Tywin Lannister, who had joined his cause late in the
        conflict and delivered the capital of King&#8217;s Landing to him. He named Jon Arryn as his Hand
        while Eddard took his father&#8217;s role as Warden of the North. \n\n Stannis fought for Robert
        through the war though the two brothers never loved each other. Despite Stannis&#8217; service
        during the war, Robert made Renly the Lord of Storm&#8217;s End following his victory. Renly was
        only a child during the war, so he did not fight. Stannis was made Lord of Dragonstone and
        served on Robert&#8217;s small council as Master of Ships. Renly later joined the small council
        as Master of Laws. \n\n Robert has been the King of the Andals and the First Men and the
        ruler of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros since the end of the civil war. However, he is more
        interested in drinking, whoring and hunting than ruling his kingdom. He revels in the glory
        days of the rebellion. He leaves running the kingdom largely to his small council, led by
        Jon Arryn. King Robert also loves to throw events such as tournaments at which he spares no
        expense. Unfortunately, after seventeen years Robert&#8217;s excesses have left the realm deeply
        in debt for a shocking six million Gold Dragons, half to House Lannister. He apparently has
        three children with Cersei: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. Unbeknownst to Robert, all three
        were actually fathered by Cersei&#8217;s twin brother Jaime Lannister. Robert has also fathered
        several illegitimate bastards, to whom he pays no attention. He has an unacknowledged
        bastard son named Gendry fathered on a tavern wench. He has an unacknowledged bastard
        daughter named Barra fathered on the prostitute Mhaegen. He has at least four other
        unacknowledged bastards fathered with various women in the city of King&#8217;s Landing alone.
        \n\n Jon Arryn began investigating the lineage of Cersei&#8217;s children, comparing their
        appearance to Robert&#8217;s bastard offspring. He died under mysterious circumstances shortly
        after beginning his investigation. Robert has decided to ride north to Eddard&#8217;s keep
        Winterfell to name him as Jon Arryn&#8217;s replacement.</string>

        died when the boys were young and Robert inherited his titles. Stannis is a serious and
        severe man. \n\n Robert led a rebellion against King Aerys II Targaryen, deposing and
        replacing him as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Stannis fought for Robert during the war.
        He was besieged at Storm&#8217;s End for much of the conflict. He was rescued from starvation by
        the smuggler Davos, who brought a ship full of onions into the castle. Stannis knighted
        Davos as a reward but also punished him for his smuggling by cutting four finger tips from
        his right hand. Davos is fiercely loyal to Stannis and saw his punishment as just. Davos&#8217;s
        son Matthos served Stannis as a scribe. Stannis went on to conquer Dragonstone, the seat
        of House Targaryen. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis destroyed the Greyjoy fleet. \n\n
        Stannis and Robert never loved one another. Despite Stannis&#8217; service during the war, Robert
        made Renly the Lord of Storm&#8217;s End following his victory. Renly was only a child during the
        civil war, so he did not fight. Stannis was made Prince of Dragonstone and served on his
        brother&#8217;s small council as Master of Ships. Though not outright cruel or malicious, he is a
        stern and humorless man, making him the least popular of the Baratheon brothers. \n\n He
        married Selyse Florent. They have a loveless marriage; Stannis regards her as sickly and
        resents her failure to bear him a son. During the first season Stannis is on Dragonstone
        for an extended stay, preferring the solitude of the island. \n\n He has converted to the
        Lord of Light under the influence of the priestess Melisandre. His household have largely
        followed his conversion. He has adopted the flaming red heart of the Lord of Light with

        surname used in the Crownlands (Waters) because he was not openly acknowledged by Robert.
        \n\n His mother worked in a tavern and died when he was very young. When he was old enough,
        an unknown lord paid his apprentice fee so he could learn to be a blacksmith. He spent his

    <!-- Character Davos Seaworth -->
    <string name="title_character_seaworth_davos">Davos Seaworth</string>
    <string name="background_character_seaworth_davos">Ser Davos Seaworth is a landed knight and a
        reformed smuggler. His ship used to ply the Narrow Sea, smuggling goods from the Free
        Cities into the Seven Kingdoms and back again. \n\n Davos was born in Flea Bottom, the
        poorest slum in King&#8217;s Landing. His father was a poor crabber. He became a sailor while
        very young to escape the slums and has spent most of his life sailing the Narrow Sea. His
        black-sailed ship became infamous for sneaking into harbors in the dead of night while
        avoiding detection. \n\n During Robert&#8217;s Rebellion, Davos aided Stannis Baratheon while he
        was besieged in Storm&#8217;s End, by delivering smuggled onions and other foodstuffs into the
        castle. The supplies helped Stannis&#8217; forces survive until the end of the war. For this
        service, Stannis rewarded Davos by bestowing him with knighthood and lands. He chose the
        name &#8220;Seaworth&#8221; for his family&#8217;s new noble House, as a reference to his smuggling past.
        Highborn members of older noble Houses disparagingly called Davos &#8220;the Onion Knight&#8221; for
        his actions, but he has embraced this title and proudly took an onion for a sigil and sewed
        it onto his ship&#8217;s sails. \n\n Stannis also cut off four finger tips from Davos&#8217; right hand
        as punishment for his smuggling crimes. Thieves in Westeros are often sentenced to having
        fingers or the whole hand removed, but Stannis only took the fingertips of his less used
        hand (his right, as Davos is left-handed). Davos submitted to this punishment willingly,
        judging it a fair exchange in return for improving his family&#8217;s future prospects. He also
        mentions in a featurette that he submitted to the punishment for the sake of sheer justice,
        saying he &#8220;avoided punishment for too long&#8221;. He wears his severed finger bones in a pouch
        about his neck and believes they bring him good luck. \n\n Davos is one of Stannis&#8217; most
        loyal and reliable vassals and arguably his best friend, but is treated with disdain by
        some of the other lords of Westeros for his low birth. Stannis himself points out that it
        was the low-born Davos, and not the high-born lords, who saved the lives of Stannis and his
        castle garrison. Davos is one of the only men who can (even grudgingly) influence Stannis&#8217;
        decisions, because he values Davos&#8217; honest advice above that of noble-born flatterers. \n\n
        Davos has several sons, including Matthos, who serves with him on his ship and is a scribe
        for Stannis. He is proud of his son&#8217;s education but remains illiterate. \n\n Even though
        Stannis&#8217; wife Selyse despises Ser Davos, their daughter Shireen is fond of him and
        considers him a friend.</string>

        Hailing from Asshai, a country located in the far east of the continent of Essos, she
        claims to wield powerful magical abilities, particularly the power of prophecy. Melisandre
        wears a large ruby necklace that seems to glow whenever she performs her magic. Some years
        ago she crossed the Narrow Sea and came to the court of Lord Stannis Baratheon on the
        island stronghold of Dragonstone, to preach her faith. Stannis and the majority of his
        household have now converted to her religion, and she has become a close adviser to Stannis

    <!-- Character Daenerys Targaryen -->
    <string name="title_character_targaryen_daenerys">Daenerys Targaryen</string>
    <string name="background_character_targaryen_daenerys">Daenerys is the only daughter and
        youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen, the &#8220;Mad King&#8221;, and his sister-wife Rhaella.
        Her father died during the Sack of King&#8217;s Landing, before she was even born. The usurper
        Robert Baratheon installed himself as king, having defeated Aerys in the conquest known as
        Robert&#8217;s Rebellion. Her pregnant mother and young brother Viserys, fled to the island of
        Dragonstone, the ancestral home of House Targaryen, to escape Robert. Daenerys&#8217;s brother
        Rhaegar Targaryen was also killed in the war and Robert&#8217;s forces murdered his wife and
        children, Daenerys&#8217;s sister-in-law, niece, and nephew, during the Sack of King&#8217;s Landing. \n\n
        On the night Daenerys was born on Dragonstone, a vast storm raged. For this reason, she is
        sometimes called &#8220;Daenerys Stormborn&#8221;. Her mother died soon after she was born, leaving her
        an orphan. As a baby, she was taken into exile in the Free Cities with her brother,
        Viserys, by loyal retainers, among them Ser Willem Darry.\n\n After years spent fruitlessly
        trying to raise support to retake the Iron Throne, Viserys and Daenerys were given
        sanctuary by Magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos. She dreams of finding a
        peaceful home and a place to belong. She lives in constant fear of Viserys, who hits her
        when his temper is risen (in his words, whenever she &#8220;wakes the dragon&#8221;). Living under
        Viserys&#8217; domination has left her meek and malleable.</string>

    <!-- Character Viserys Targaryen -->

    <string name="background_character_targaryen_viserys">Viserys is the second son and heir of
        King Aerys II Targaryen, the former ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. During Robert&#8217;s Rebellion,
        after Viserys&#8217;s older brother Rhaegar was killed at the Battle of the Trident, his father
        sent Viserys and his pregnant mother Queen Rhaella to safety on Dragonstone island. King
        Aerys was soon afterwards killed during the Sack of King&#8217;s Landing along with Rhaegar&#8217;s
        widow and children, and thus at the age of only five Viserys became the titular head of
        House Targaryen, though by this point the war was officially lost. Not long afterwards,
        his mother died in childbirth, while the forces of Robert Baratheon closed in on the
        island. Before they could arrive, Viserys and his baby sister Daenerys were smuggled to
        safety in the Free Cities, across the Narrow Sea on the continent of Essos. Bereft of
        followers, Viserys spent the next 17 years travelling between the Free Cities trying to
        find new supporters for an attempt to retake the Iron Throne. At times, however, he was
        left literally begging for food and shelter, much less an army. \n\n Viserys claims the
        title of Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and refers to Robert Baratheon only as &#8220;the Usurper&#8221;.
        After years spent fruitlessly wandering the Free Cities seeking military support to retake
        his throne, Viserys and Daenerys became guests of the powerful Magister Illyrio Mopatis of
        Pentos.</string>

    <!-- Character Aerys II Targaryen -->
    <string name="title_character_targaryen_aerys">Aerys II Targaryen</string>
    <string name="background_character_targaryen_aerys">Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name,
        was King of the Seven Kingdoms and the last member of House Targaryen to sit on the Iron
        Throne. Popularly remembered as &#8220;the Mad King&#8221;, his reign became increasingly erratic and
        murderous. A final round of blood-letting, unleashed when his son, Prince Rhaegar,
        kidnapped Lyanna Stark of Winterfell, saw many houses in the realm rebel against his rule.
        Brandon Stark protested the abduction of his sister and demanded justice. Aerys had him
        arrested for treason and then offered to ransom him to his father. When Rickard Stark rode
        to King&#8217;s Landing to ransom Brandon, Aerys had him arrested too, and then brutally executed
        both father and son. \n\n The noble houses of Stark, Tully, Arryn, and Baratheon raised the
        flags of rebellion and destroyed the royalist armies in several major engagements,
        culminating in the Battle of the Trident where Prince Rhaegar fell. King Aerys was betrayed
        by his former friend and King&#8217;s Hand, Lord Tywin Lannister, who led an army to apparently
        defend the capital at King&#8217;s Landing but instead brutally sacked the city. \n\n Aerys had
        already instructed Wisdom Rossart, his new Hand of the King, to hide caches of wildfire all
        over King&#8217;s Landing. He then decreed that the capital be set ablaze. Aerys seemingly
        believed the massive inferno would transmute him into a dragon and he would emerge to
        obliterate his enemies. To prevent the King incinerating the city and its half a million
        inhabitants, Ser Jaime Lannister, a member of the Kingsguard, stabbed Aerys in the back and
        then cut his throat. \n\n Aerys&#8217; death brought to an end the Targaryen dynasty, which had
        ruled the Seven Kingdoms for three centuries. He was replaced on the Iron Throne by the
        leader of the rebels, Robert Baratheon. However, the Targaryen bloodline survived through
        his two youngest children, Viserys and Daenerys, who were spirited away to the Free
        Cities.</string>

    <string name="title_character_targaryen_rhaegar">Rhaegar Targaryen</string>
    <string name="background_character_targaryen_rhaegar">Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was the eldest
        son and heir to the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, by his wife and sister Queen Rhaella
        Targaryen. Tywin Lannister desired for his daughter Cersei to marry Rhaegar, but King
        Aerys II insulted Tywin by indicating that such a match would be beneath Rhaegar. Instead,
        Rhaegar was married to Princess Elia Martell of Dorne, with whom he had a daughter named
        Rhaenys and then a son named Aegon. In spite of Elia&#8217;s love and loyalty to him, Rhaegar
        abducted Lyanna Stark of Winterfell for unknown reasons. \n\n After the Mad King had Lyanna
        Stark&#8217;s father Rickard Stark and oldest brother Brandon Stark executed after the latter
        brazenly rode to the capital, demanding Rhaegar release Lyanna, her other brother, Eddard
        Stark, and her betrothed, Robert Baratheon, joined forces with several other houses to
        overthrow the Targaryen dynasty. This war became known as the War of the Usurper or
        Robert&#8217;s Rebellion. After initially remaining away from the fighting in Dorne, Rhaegar was
        summoned to lead the Royalist forces in what would be the Battle of the Trident. During the
        Battle, Rhaegar was killed in single combat with Lyanna&#8217;s betrothed Robert Baratheon.
        Rhaegar was struck down with a massive blow from Robert&#8217;s warhammer, which scattered the
        rubies encrusted in Rhaegar&#8217;s armor under the water. That location was named the &#8220;Ruby
        Ford&#8221; thereafter. \n\n His father was killed shortly afterwards by Ser Jaime Lannister
        during the Sack of King&#8217;s Landing and his mother died in childbirth at Dragonstone. His
        younger brother Viserys and sister Daenerys (who was born after Rhaegar&#8217;s death) survived
        in exile in the Free Cities across the sea. Lyanna also died during the war. Rhaenys and
        Aegon were killed in front of Elia by Ser Gregor Clegane better known as &#8217;The Mountain&#8217;
        and afterwards raped Elia and fatally stabbed her with his sword.</string>

    <!-- Character Aemon Targaryen -->

    <string name="background_character_targaryen_aemon">Aemon was born into the royal House
        Targaryen, the son of King Maekar I. Unlike the majority of his forbears, Aemon and his
        brothers were not born out of marriage between brother and sister. Their father and
        grandfather respectively married Dyanna of House Dayne and Myriah of House Martell.
        Originally known as Prince Aemon Targaryen, he was not his father&#8217;s eldest son, so he
        eventually joined the order of Maesters. Aemon gave up all rights to inheritance when he
        took his vows, which also included dropping his surname &#8220;Targaryen&#8221;. \n\n Aemon&#8217;s older
        brother, Aerion, later died, however, and despite being a sworn maester there were those
        who felt that the crown should pass to him. Aemon refused the throne, however, and it
        passed to his younger brother, who became King Aegon V. Aemon then joined the Night&#8217;s Watch
        to remove himself from the political intrigues of the royal court, and those who wished to
        set him up as a rival against his brother. \n\n Many years later the crown passed to Aegon
        V&#8217;s son, Aemon&#8217;s nephew Aerys II, called &#8220;The Mad King&#8221;. Aerys&#8217;s growing insanity
        ultimately led to the outbreak of Robert&#8217;s Rebellion, which saw House Targaryen deposed
        and practically exterminated. Upon hearing about the brutal death of his family in King&#8217;s
        Landing during the rebellion, Aemon bore great sadness which has never left him. \n\n
        Around one hundred years old, Aemon is thought to be one of the oldest living men in
        Westeros, though he has retained all of his wits and his mind is still very sharp. He has
        served as the maester at Castle Black for many decades. \n\n Aemon has long since gone
        blind due to old age. It is not clear when he went blind (he was not born blind), though
        he has stated that he was already old and blind during Robert&#8217;s Rebellion. As a man of
        learning, he laments not being able to read anymore, even though Castle Black ironically
        has an ancient and well-stocked library consisting of thousands of books. Because one of a
        maester&#8217;s basic duties is to handle messages sent to and from a castle by messenger-ravens,
        Aemon has to rely on the assistance of others to physically read the letters for
        him.</string>

        non-Dothraki. Amongst their own people they have a code of honor, albeit still a harsh and
        unforgiving one. Drogo was very young to have his own khalasar, particularly such a large
        one. He is a legendary warrior and has never been defeated in battle. Drogo desired the
        most beautiful and exotic woman in the world as his khaleesi or wife, and enlisted Magister
        Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos to help him find such a woman. \n\n He is guarded by bloodriders
        including Qotho. Generals or ko in his khalasar include Pono and Jhaqo, men who guard him,

        childhood. It later is revealed that he is originally from the Summer Islands and was taken
        by the slavers in a raid as a baby. He has no memory of his life before being an Unsullied.

    <string name="background_character_naharis_daario">Daario is a Tyroshi sellsword, employed as a
        lieutenant in the Second Sons. He is apparently held in high enough regard by the company&#8217;s
        co-captains, Mero and Prendahl na Ghezn, that they allow him to join them in contract
        negotiations and discussions of the company&#8217;s future. \n\n According to Daario, his mother
        was a prostitute, and he comes from low beginnings. At the age of 12, Daario was sold by
        his mother to a slave master from Tolos due to her declining income, alcoholism and his
        aggressive, unruly behavior and tendency to get into fights with other boys. He was trained
        as a pit fighter and had his first match in the pits when he was 16. Daario rose to fame
        within the fighting pits earning his master so much money that at the time of his master&#8217;s
        death Daario was rewarded with freedom. Daario chose to fight as a sellsword for the Second
        Sons sometime after that. \n\n Besides being fluent in the Common Tongue, Daario is also
        fluent in High Valyrian considering he is of Tyroshi origin. \n\n Daario has an unusual
        code for a sellsword; he won&#8217;t sleep with prostitutes and only kills soldiers who are
        trying to kill him, not bystanders. He does this because he feels that otherwise there is
        no sport and it is not exciting. Daario has said that the gods gave men two things to
        entertain themselves with before they die: the thrill of having sex with a woman who
        earnestly wants it, and the thrill of killing a man who is trying to kill you first. \n\n
        Daario is a highly skilled and extremely capable warrior. Being trained a pit fighter since
        the age of 12 and then fighting as a sellsword after that, mostly all of Daario&#8217;s life has
        revolved around fighting. During his years as a pit fighter he learned to fight with
        several different fighting styles; like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest and a
        Westerosi knight. Daario has over several different occasions proven his skills in combat:
        when he reveals to Daenerys that he single-handedly managed to kill both of the commanding
        officers of the Second Sons, when he along Ser Jorah and Grey Worm fight severely
        outnumbered against several guards in the streets of Yunkai, when he kills the Champion of
        Meereen in single combat with ease or when protecting Daenerys, Tyrion, and Missandei from
        hundreds of Sons of the Harpy along with Ser Jorah, coming out on top, unharmed, despite
        being outnumbered severely. \n\n Daario&#8217;s weapons-of-choice are a Dothraki arakh and a
        Myrish stiletto, both which have gold-plated custom-made hilts in the shape of beautiful,
        naked women. His fighting style is based on speed and quick, accurate strikes with few,
        mostly finishing, blows based on pure strength due to his relatively small size and lean
        build compared to the larger, stronger opponents he frequently faced in the fighting
        pits.</string>

        King&#8217;s Landing, and Prince Oberyn, known as The Red Viper, also killed by Clegane. \n\n He
        suffers from a severe case of gout, which mostly prevents him from walking and restricts
        him to a wheelchair. \n\n Unlike his more hotheaded and aggressive brother, Oberyn, Doran
        is a pensive, calculating, and patient man who always waits and observes before making his
        next move. Despite their different personalities, the two brothers were very close. While
        Oberyn could indulge in the wayward Dornish ways, challenging whomever he liked regardless
        of the consequences, Doran was raised to be more responsible as the heir to the Dornish
        throne. He truly cares for both his people and his family, and would never make a decision
        that would go against their interests. However, this is often against their wishes. \n\n
        Doran has also been a witness to war and was deeply marked by its consequences. As such,
        he often tries to find a solution that avoids waging war, even if the honor of House
        Martell has been offended. This, along with his physical weakness, gives some people the
        impression that he is weak-willed and can be easily dominated, but this is misleading;
        Doran is just as ruthless and decisive as any other member of House Martell. He&#8217;s simply

        ruler of Dorne, and an older sister of Prince Oberyn. Her marriage to Prince Rhaegar
        was arranged by King Aerys II Targaryen and considered an insult by Tywin Lannister,
        Aerys&#8217;s Hand of the King, who had proposed his daughter Cersei as a bride for the Prince
        but was rejected. The marriage was one of the reasons Lord Tywin resigned his post as
        Hand. Like her younger brother, Elia was very popular among the Dornish people. \n\n As a
        teenager, Elia accompanied her brother Oberyn on a visit to Casterly Rock. While there,
        Elia and Oberyn were eager to see the monster that had just been born. Cersei finally
        showed them the baby, but the Martell siblings were somewhat disappointed to see that
        Tyrion was just a baby, and somewhat disturbed by Cersei&#8217;s already strong hatred of him.
        \n\n Elia loved her husband Prince Rhaegar dearly. She bore him two children, Rhaenys and
        Aegon, to whom she was equally devoted; according to Oberyn, Elia took care of them from
        birth, rather than delegating the task to a wet nurse. Both pregnancies were very
        difficult, and each nearly killed Elia. \n\n When Robert&#8217;s Rebellion erupted, Elia was
        kept in King&#8217;s Landing by King Aerys to ensure the loyalty of House Martell during the
        conflict- a measure the Martells considered unnecessary, as they would always fight for
        whichever side Elia was on and had no intention of breaking their oaths of loyalty to the
        Targaryens. Ultimately Rhaegar was killed in personal combat with Robert Baratheon at the
        Battle of the Trident, leaving Elia widowed. A few weeks later during the Sack of King&#8217;s
        Landing, Tywin Lannister&#8217;s army betrayed the Targaryens and overran the city. Ser Gregor
        Clegane - known as &#8220;The Mountain That Rides&#8221; burst into the royal chambers and before
        Elia&#8217;s eyes, killed her daughter Rhaenys, then bashed her infant son&#8217;s head in against a
        wall. Covered in the blood and gore of her children, Gregor proceeded to brutally rape
        Elia, and finally he killed her. It is rumored that he cut her in half with his
        greatsword, though Gregor himself later confesses to &#8220;smashing her head in&#8221;. \n\n Elia&#8217;s
        death deeply alienated her family from the crown after Robert ascended the throne, and
        their hatred of the Lannisters now knew no bounds. Subsequently they were never seen and
        rarely if ever mentioned at the royal court in King&#8217;s Landing.</string>

    <!-- Character Oberyn Martell -->
    <string name="title_character_martell_oberyn">Oberyn Martell</string>
    <string name="background_character_martell_oberyn">Prince Oberyn is the younger brother of
        Prince Doran Martell and Princess Elia Martell; like most members of House Martell, he is
        styled &#8220;Prince&#8221; instead of &#8220;Lord&#8221;. He is nicknamed &#8220;the Red Viper&#8221; for his knowledge of
        poisons and for his unusual, deadly style of combat. Oberyn is known for being an
        accomplished warrior, but he is just as infamous for his sexual appetite, which extends to
        both men and women; Tyrion Lannister tells Bronn that Oberyn is &#8220;famous for fucking half of
        Westeros&#8221;. Oberyn&#8217;s paramour is Ellaria Sand; she is his wife in all but name, and Doran
        once noted that Ellaria made Oberyn very happy. She is also the mother of five of Oberyn&#8217;s
        infamous eight bastard daughters, all of whom he has acknowledged and given his love and
        care. He named the fifth one, Elia Sand, after his late sister. \n\n When he was a teenager,
        Oberyn was accompianed by his big sister Elia on a visit to Casterly Rock. While there,
        Oberyn and Elia were eager to see the &#8220;monster&#8221; that had just been born. Cersei finally
        showed them Tyrion, but the Martell siblings were somewhat disappointed to see that he was
        just a baby, and somewhat disturbed by Cersei&#8217;s already strong hatred of him. \n\n Prince
        Oberyn trained at the Citadel in his youth, in order to become a maester. Although he
        ultimately grew bored and abandoned his studies, he managed to forge several links in a
        maester&#8217;s chain, and became well versed in the use of poisons in the process. When he was
        sixteen, an older nobleman caught Oberyn in bed with his mistress and challenged Oberyn to
        a duel to first blood; Oberyn won the duel, and several days later the man died from
        festering wounds, likely because Oberyn had poisoned his blade. Oberyn also travelled to
        Essos in his youth; for a time, he served in the mercenary company known as the Second Sons.
        He once went to the city of Astapor there and saw the Unsullied, whom he jokingly remarked
        were impressive on the battlefield, but less so in the bedroom. He lived in Essos for a
        total of five years. It is implied that Oberyn fought duels in the infamous fighting pits
        of Meereen, as he mentions to Tyrion that he learned some of his combat techniques
        &#8220;during his years in the fighting pits&#8221;. \n\n Despite his wayward ways and liberal attitude
        towards sexuality, Oberyn is very devoted to his family, telling his lover Ellaria that any
        other person would always have to wait behind her for his affection. He was very close with
        his sister, Elia, and took her death very hard. As a result, he had a strong and fierce
        hatred for House Lannister, especially towards Tywin Lannister, whom he believed ordered
        his sister&#8217;s murder. He was also close to his older brother, Doran, despite their very
        different personalities.</string>

    <!-- Character Ellaria Sand -->
    <string name="title_character_sand_ellaria">Ellaria Sand</string>
    <string name="background_character_sand_ellaria">Ellaria is the mother of four of Prince
        Oberyn Martell&#8217;s eight bastard daughters. Her eldest daughter is Tyene. Like Oberyn,
        Ellaria is attracted to both men and women.</string>

    <!-- Character Obara Sand -->
    <string name="title_character_sand_obara">Obara Sand</string>
    <string name="background_character_sand_obara">Obara Sand is the eldest of the &#8220;Sand Snakes&#8221;,
        the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, and was named in honor of her father.
        Her mother was a peasant. \n\n Even more than her sisters, Obara inherited her father&#8217;s
        martial prowess, particularly his skill with a spear. She is a very tough warrior and the
        most overtly martial of the Sand Snakes. The other Sand Snakes will change out of their
        light leather armor when traveling in the hot deserts of Dorne, but Obara always wears her
        leather armor. She also tends to dress in a more masculine style than her sisters, even
        when not in combat. When she sees an obstacle, she does not attempt to undermine it with
        deception or intrigue, but will attack it head-on, relying on her skill and the strength of
        her weapons. This is in contrast with her sister Nymeria, who prefers to hold off and
        analyze her foes to calculate a more efficient means of defeating them. \n\n Obara is the
        Sand Snake most like their father. He taught her the ways of war himself, training her in
        the use of a traditional Dornish spear like he used. Unlike most Dornishmen, who are
        overtly passionate, Obara is staunchly disciplined to not overtly display her emotions.
        This is largely due to her origins: unlike her sisters Nymeria and Tyene, Obara&#8217;s mother
        was not a noblewoman, so when Oberyn came to take her to court, she had to choose between
        staying or going, the latter meaning she would never see her mother again. As a result, she
        has a cold and hardened demeanor, though she deeply loves her family. This is not to say
        that Obara is the most rational of the sisters (Nymeria is the most rational and
        calculating one). She is actually quite irrational and ruled by her emotions, she just
        doesn&#8217;t outwardly show them that much. The difference is that in a situation where Tyene
        would aggressively shout insults at an enemy and attack them, Obara would just silently
        walk straight up to them and stab them without saying a word. Nymeria, in contrast, would
        hold back and attempt to assess if there would be a more opportune moment to strike at a
        later time. \n\n Obara is loosely the lead Sand Snake, because she is eldest and probably
        the best fighter. Her sister Nymeria does nothing without her approval. Her father Oberyn
        and Nymeria were the only two people that Obara ever fully trusted. As her close confident,
        Nymeria is also the only person who can say &#8220;no&#8221; to Obara: while they may seem to argue at
        times, conversely this is because Nymeria is the only person that Obara will at least pay
        heed to - for anyone else, arguing with Obara is useless once she has her mind set on
        something. Nymeria is the only person Obara will ever take advice from (after their
        father&#8217;s death).</string>

    <!-- Character Nymeria Sand -->
    <string name="title_character_sand_nymeria">Nymeria Sand</string>
    <string name="background_character_sand_nymeria">Nymeria Sand is the second of the eight
        bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the &#8220;Sand Snakes&#8221;. Nymeria&#8217;s mother
        was an Eastern noblewoman, who taught her how to use a whip in combat, but who later died
        in battle. Nymeria became very skilled with using her 8 foot long bullwhip in combat. \n\n
        Nymeria inherited her father&#8217;s cunning, and is the most observant and calculating of the
        Sand Snakes. Instead of charging head-on into a situation relying on brute strength (like
        her older sister Obara), she will stand back and observe her enemy&#8217;s weak points, then move
        in precisely for an accurate strike. In this, she is actually more like her uncle, Doran
        Martell, than like her father. Her choice of a bullwhip as her primary weapon exemplifies
        this mentality. She hones her reflexes by playing a sparring game with her younger sister
        Tyene, in which one slaps the other&#8217;s hands before they can move them; Nymeria claims she
        has never lost this game.\n\n Nymeria dresses more femininely than her martial sister Obara,
        though she is no less deadly. Nymeria has long flowing hair, and alluring Dornish-style
        dresses. \n\n She is named after Nymeria, the warrior-queen of the Rhoynar who led her
        people&#8217;s migration to Dorne one thousand years ago. The original Nymeria unified Dorne for
        the first time, and is considered the founder of House Martell in its modern form.
        &#8220;Nymeria&#8221; is a popular name in Dorne, much as &#8220;Brandon&#8221; is in the North, after their
        founder Brandon the Builder. Through her father Oberyn, Nymeria Sand is actually a direct
        descendant of the original Nymeria.</string>

    <!-- Character Tyene Sand -->
    <string name="title_character_sand_tyene">Tyene Sand</string>
    <string name="background_character_sand_tyene">Tyene Sand is the third of the eight bastard
        daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the &#8220;Sand Snakes&#8221;. She is also his eldest
        daughter by his paramour, Ellaria Sand. Tyene fights using a pair of long daggers, though
        her other signature weapon is her skill with poisons - a tactic she learned from her
        father. Like her father, she is known to coat her blades with poisons, making a single
        scratch lethal. \n\n Tyene can feign being soft-spoken and childlike, but this is just an
        act to keep her enemies off guard, as she is just as fierce as her older sisters. \n\n Tyene
        is the youngest of the four adult Sand Snakes, and more impetuous than her older sisters
        Obara and Nymeria. Where Obara will face threats head-on (confident in her martial prowess),
        and Nymeria will stand back and analyze the situation to make a precise strike at her
        enemy&#8217;s weak points, Tyene tends to heedlessly charge ahead. This is exemplified by her
        choice of daggers as her main hand-held weapon: they are quick on the draw, allowing her
        to lash out quickly, before even her older sisters can restrain her.</string>

    <!-- Character Areo Hotah -->

        the northern Free Cities. He joined the Martell household at Sunspear along with Prince
        Doran&#8217;s wife, a Norvoshi noblewoman. He has been a trusted servant of the Martells for
        many years, and is renowned for his skill with his halberd. Hotah&#8217;s motto is &#8220;Serve,
        Protect, Obey&#8221;.</string>
